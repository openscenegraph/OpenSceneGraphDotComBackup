<p>PERTHSHIRE, Scotland - 28th June 2011 - OpenSceneGraph Professional Services announces the release of OpenSceneGraph 3.0, the industry's leading open-source scene graph technology, designed to accelerate application development and improve 3D graphics performance. OpenSceneGraph 3.0 written entirely in Standard C++ and built upon OpenGL, offers developers working in the visual simulation, game development, virtual reality, scientific visualization and modeling markets - a real-time visualization tool which eclipses commercial scene graph toolkits in functionality, stability and performance. OpenSceneGraph 3.0 runs on all Microsoft Windows platforms, Apple OS/X, IOS, GNU/Linux, Android, IRIX, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and FreeBSD operating systems.</p>
<h3 id="Open-sourcedevelopmentdeliversindustry-leadingfeaturesandperformance">Open-source development delivers industry-leading features and performance</h3>
<p>The OpenSceneGraph 3.0 release is the culmination of 12 years of work by the lead developers and the open-source community that has grown up around the project. The real-time graphics industry and academia embraced it from the very beginning, deploying it in real-world applications, and actively participating in its development, testing and refinement. The end result is a high-quality library with a feature set relevant to application developers' needs.</p>
