<p>PERTHSHIRE, Scotland - 4th July 2014 - OpenSceneGraph Professional Services announces the release of OpenSceneGraph 3.2.1, the industry's leading open-source scene graph technology, designed to accelerate application development and improve 3D graphics performance. OpenSceneGraph 3.2.1 written entirely in Standard C++ and built upon OpenGL, offers developers working in the visual simulation, game development, virtual reality, scientific visualization and modeling markets - a real-time visualization tool which eclipses commercial scene graph toolkits in functionality, stability and performance. OpenSceneGraph 3.2.1 runs on all Microsoft Windows platforms, Apple OS/X, IOS, GNU/Linux, Android, IRIX, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and FreeBSD operating systems.</p>
<h3>Open-source development delivers industry-leading features and performance</h3>
<p>The OpenSceneGraph 3.2.1 stable release is the culmination of 15 years of work by the open-source community that has grown up around the project. This point release is fully binary compatible with the 3.2.0 stable release.  The changes made are focused on addressing bugs and improving build support for latest compilers, OS updates and 3rd changes to Party Libraries.</p>
<h3>Downloads and Licensing</h3>
<p>OpenSceneGraph is open-source, so full source code is provided, and can be copied, modified and used free of charge for commercial and non-commercial use. Access to the source allows end users greater flexibility in how they develop, debug and deploy their applications.  They gain productivity and freedom by being able to leverage the tool chain in accordance with their own release cycles. Downloads of binaries and source can be found in the  <a href="https://www.openscenegraph.com/index.php/download-section/stable-releases">Downloads</a> section of the openscenegraph.org website.</p>
<p>OpenSceneGraph is released under the <a href="https://www.openscenegraph.com/projects/osg/wiki/Legal">OpenSceneGraph Public License</a>, which is based on the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL), permitting the software to be used free of charge across the full spectrum of commercial and open-source applications.  Furthermore, it allows both static and dynamic linking of the OpenSceneGraph libraries without restricting the licensing of the user's software.</p>
