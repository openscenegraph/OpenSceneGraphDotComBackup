<PRE>HI Adrian,

Z fighting is a basic topic for real-time computer graphics, we can't
be responsible for teaching you everything about computer graphics

As for primitives well again it's basic topic for real-time computer
graphics, just like OpenGL the OSG uses the primitives, we've adopted
the same language for the same features when wrapping up OpenGL
features in the OSG.

To understand primitives have a look online, or at OSG examples like
osggeometry, in particular where it sets of the PrimitiveSet's for the
geometry.  Also have a look at the
OpenSceneGraph/include/osg/PrimitiveSet header class.

Robert.

&gt;<i> Hi Robert,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks for your help. The big problem is that whenever you Google an issue as Z Fighting, a trillion results appear about somebodies similar issue in a forum which usually ends up in the answer being &quot;it is probably z fighting, there are many answers on the internet if you Google it&quot; :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After several days of Googling I have gathered very little information. There is a distinct lack of examples available on the internet and I am yet to find a single site which can explain to me what each of the settings such as DO_NOT_COMPUTE_NEAR_FAR, COMPUTE_NEAR_FAR_USING_PRIMITIVES etc actually does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For my own particular problem I found that the following link was the most helpful so far:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.sjbaker.org/steve/omniv/love_your_z_buffer.html">https://www.sjbaker.org/steve/omniv/love_your_z_buffer.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This explained to me some of the issues associated with Z fighting and that I can't make my fustrum as big as I want it to be. I then found, mainly by trial and error, that the setting COMPUTE_NEAR_FAR_USING_PRIMITIVES works the best in my situation. I am yet to find any documentation that tells me how to set the &quot;primitives&quot;. Is there actually a location on the internet that has documentation about OSG as opposed to API definitions or forum questions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks for your help.
