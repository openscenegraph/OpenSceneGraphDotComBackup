<PRE>Hi James,

Almost all the updating of the scene graph is not threadsafe and meant to
be updated from a single threaded update section/traversal. Normally this
would be invoked in the main loop like the viewer.updateTraversal() or in
custom update osg::Operation assigned to the viewer, or through subclassing
of Viewer::updateTraversal().

The exception is where you have a subgraph that is wholly created and
updated within a background thread before being assigned to the viewer.

&gt;<i>From your description it'll be the ParticularSystemUpdater that is causing
</I>problems.  Caching all the required particle addition in a thread safe
container and applying them as a batch in the updateTraversal would be how
I'd do it.  An update callback assigned to the ParticuleSystemUpdater could
probably do this.  This callback would be the thread safe container or
&quot;have a&quot; thread safe container then the loaders also know about.

Or simply create a subclass from ParticularSystemUpdater to add a thread
safe container within it and custom handling of this during update.

I had to add, I haven't tried this with type of usage with osgPairicle, and
I'm rather rusty as my focus has been on the VSG for the past two years :-)


Robert.

&gt;<i> Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> - what is the thread-safety / expected thread calling restrictions on

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In FlightGear, we create ParticleSystems in some custom osgDB loaders, and

</I>&gt;<i> ParticleSystemUpdater, in those osgDB threads. We suspect this might be a
</I>&gt;<i> race condition given the lack of locking in
</I>&gt;<i> ParticleSystemUpdater::addParticleSystem and others. I wondered if it was
</I>&gt;<i> expected to only touch the PSU from the main thread, for example. Eg by
</I>&gt;<i> deferring adding to the PSU to an UpdateCallback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - what is the expected lifetime model of ParticleSystems/Updaters?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have a single global PSU, but since the PSU takes an owning ref_ptr to
</I>&gt;<i> each added ParticleSystem, I suspect we are in practice never freeing any
</I>&gt;<i> particle systems, even once the node which owns them in the scene, is
</I>&gt;<i> unloaded/removed. (By the scenery tile expiring in our cache)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would have expected the PSU to use a weak-ref / osg::Observer onto the
</I>&gt;<i> ParticleSystem, but maybe having a single global PSU is not the intended
</I>&gt;<i> design here, perhaps we should be having one PSU per scenery tile (covers a
</I>&gt;<i> few square km), or something else again? Or maybe I need to add an Observer
</I>&gt;<i> on the parent Node, to call PSU::removeParticleSystem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any pointers on best practice for this would be welcome. Maybe this is the
</I>&gt;<i> wrong design for managing the creation and destruction of ParticleSystems
</I>&gt;<i> in a long-lived scene such as a flight simulator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
