<PRE>Hi Franco,

Posting screenshots is fine, and exactly the thing to do with these types
of problems.

It's not possible to diagnose the exact problem you are seeing with
rendering under OSG-3.6.5.  Broadly it looks like a depth test issue.

I don't know if this is relevant, but will mention it as some others have
been caught out by it. One of the bug fixes in the OSG-3.x series was to
fix an override of the osg::Camera settings that was causing applications
settings to be lost.  The fix had the side effect of revealing missing
settings, in essence it was a bug A that hide a bug B that only occurred
with certain usage models.

So bug A has been fixed and bug B usage case is an application creates a
viewer osg::Camera, sets up a graphics context, then just directly assigns
it to the viewer without setting any global state that is required for top
level osg::Camera.  The state not set includes GL_DEPTH_TEST - which is
where there &quot;might&quot; be an overlap with the problem you see with your
application.

Normal OSG usage where you use the Viewer Camera's that are assigned by
default also call StateSet::setGlobalDefaults() on this StateSet, so you
never see a problem.  All the OSG examples provided in the OpenSceneGraph
distribution do this.

However, the problem usage cause was something that was done in early osgQt
based examples - they created a local osg::Camera assigned to the viewer
and never called StateSet::setGlobalDefaults() on the osg::Camera's
StateSet.   These examples used to work fine, even with this ill defined
state because of Bug A.  If you copied one of these examples then you'll
inherit this bug B usage case.

If this is the case then can either:

    1) Just use the viewer(views) Camera via Viewer/View::getCamera() to
get the Camera to assign the GraphicsContext to, so utilize the default
settings.
    2) Call:  camera-&gt;getOrCreateStateSet()-&gt;setGlobalDefaults() on the
locally created Camera before it's assigned to the View(er).

There was a lot of discussion about this problem usage case and the
solution when bug A was fixed and bug B revealed, but that's quite a few
years ago now - had your software been updated more regularly it's likely
you'll have seen discussions.

Cheers,
Robert.
