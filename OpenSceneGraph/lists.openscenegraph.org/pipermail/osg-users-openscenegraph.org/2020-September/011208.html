<PRE>Hi,

I'm currently in the process of updating an application that originally used OSG version 2.8.2, I didn't write the application and I'm not very familiar with OSG or OpenGL.

I didn't have to change too much to get it working with OSG 3.6.5, just the addition of a vertex shader to compute coordinates as the original version just used gl_TexCoord[0] from inside the fragment shader.

The application displays seismic data as 2D planes comprising square tiles of 2D textures, the fragment shader is just assigning a colour from a colour scale to each sample value. The planes can be oriented along any of the x,y and z axes and intersect at right angles and it's at the intersection of the planes where I'm seeing something odd in my new version.

At the point where orthogonal planes intersect, a rotated view shows that the foreground plane isn't properly occluding the planes behind and I can see this has something to do with the texture2D tile size as the smaller the size the less pronounced the effect.

There's also a wire frame to show the bounds of the display and even that doesn't appear to be drawn correctly with respect to which bits should be visible.

I'm going to attach a couple of pictures - is that allowed on this list? The first will be the original application and the second my updated version.

I haven't changed any of the code that positions the planes and they do look to be in the right place but rotating the scene creates the very odd effect I hope you can see in the second screen shot.

Any hints as to where to look for the problem would be much appreciated.

Cheers,
Franco
