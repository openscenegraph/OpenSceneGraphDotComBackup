<PRE>Hi Robert! Thank you for your kind reply.

The scene is completely static and motionless :)

</I>

Ok, perfect. I'm pretty sure that the compilation process is already performed on the entire scene by the system I'm working on.
Do you think that my problem could be caused by a missing compilation of objects? If you say that it might be the case, I will investigate more on this.

Do you think this might be the case? Is there a way in OSG to tell if an object is already in the GPU memory? And to push them there?
I remind you that once I scan the all scene with my vision the problem disappears and I can look around without any frame drop.
So I guess that the GPU memory is enough to handle the whole scene, I just need to force some sort of &quot;pre-loading&quot; of ALL objects.

</I>

As I said, my conclusion is that I don't have any actual system bottleneck, I just have to get rid of this lazy loading process :)
I just need to tell the GPU &quot;hey, here's my scene, I know you can handle it all, just pre-process it in one shot and don't wait for me to look around!&quot;
But I could be completely wrong and I'd love to know what you guys think about it. I want to 1) learn more about OSG and VR 2) solve this annoying problem.
