<PRE>In the particular test case I'm looking at, it's about 5 gigs of texture and 2 gigs of video RAM. We have a manual mechanism for downsampling, but then we can end up in situations where a processed file that looks fine on a machine with 6 or 8 gigs of video ram won't load on one with far less.

Obviously, this is an absurdly profligate use of video memory, but if you've got the data, you might as well use it.

What do you mean by &quot;have a graphics operation/callback that forces a texture compile&quot; ? Is that sort of thing covered in the osg examples?

Hi Alistair,

There isn't a mechanism built into the OSG to automatically provide a way of checking and then handling texture objects not being allocated due to out of memory issues, thankfully this isn't a common issue so doesn't trip up most users.  The best way to catch this case would probably be to have a graphics operation/callback that forces a texture compile for the textures in question and then immediately check the GL errors.

What size texture were you seeing issues with?  What is the GPU memory available?

Robert.
