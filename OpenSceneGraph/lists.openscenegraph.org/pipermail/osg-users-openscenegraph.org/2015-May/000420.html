<PRE>Hi,

Could you branch/tag the new Windows-only code into a separate branch,
please? It would make life easier for the folks like me who have the older
DK1/DK2 HMDs and need it to work on Linux/Mac for example.

&lt;rant&gt;
It is really unfortunate that Oculus is making the integration of their
stuff harder and more complicated with every SDK revision instead of the
opposite :( I am seriously starting to look at the alternatives now, the
Oculus kit is becoming way too much pain to deal with and for little
benefit.

I also wonder how is the OpenHMD (<A HREF="http://openhmd.net/">http://openhmd.net/</A>) effort doing - the
last I have looked they had DK1 support, now they seem to have DK2 as well,
but no positional tracking support. However, there seems to be some
impressive independent work being done on that here:
<A HREF="http://doc-ok.org/?p=1095">http://doc-ok.org/?p=1095</A>

There is also OSVR which includes HMD support, but I believe they have only
plugins using the official SDK (?)

So in the end, it might be possible to have a fully independent, open and
*sane* SDK even for Oculus.
&lt;/rant&gt;
