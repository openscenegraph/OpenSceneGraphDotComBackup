<PRE>Robert,

There is already a define around all the priority scheduling
calls to protect people from accidentally using them:

#ifdef ALLOW_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING

Which seems to have to be defined in the calling program as I cannot find this any place inside of OSG other than the pthreads source.

Maybe this would suffice for now to protect these calls.  I am going to suspect that few Linux users are defining this since the only reason to do so would be to use the calls that are currently ifdef'd out looking at the code inside of the ALLOW_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING define.

I agree with you about Linux not originally supporting the full suite of the pthread extensions.  Linux has come a long way in recent years.  We have been using these real-time pthread scheduling parameters though for at least 5 or 6 years now on our other Linux applications that do not need OpenSceneGraph support.  So the support on Linux has been there for awhile.

Is it possible to contact the original author on this subject, if so who would I contact?

Hopefully we will get some more comments on this topic for the OSG community...

... 

Thank you!

Cheers,
Curtis
