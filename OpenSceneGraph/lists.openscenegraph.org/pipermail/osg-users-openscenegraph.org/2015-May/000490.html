<PRE>Hi Joshua,

FYI, the OSG is used widely in the thousands of different corporations
and research groups around the world.  Think of the top names in
aerospace and other similar professional sectors and you'll be naming
companies that use the OSG.   It's used to widely because, you know
it's &quot;stuff that works&quot; on many different OS's and build
configurations, across any different versions of OpenGL, and has been
doing so for thousands of users for way over a decade.

It's unfortunate that you've hit build error on your on your
particular dev environment, I have little doubt it'll be a trivial fix
once we found out why it Cmake failed to configure on your system.

We can offer to help, but sometimes you have to give back a little
help for other to help you.  If you can see beyond what is likely to
be trivial problem then is best to keep moving on to another toolkit
in the hope that somehow it'll work in every single way you want it,
and hope that the community is a patient with you often poor level of
respect you show for the time and work of others as we have been.

Robert.
