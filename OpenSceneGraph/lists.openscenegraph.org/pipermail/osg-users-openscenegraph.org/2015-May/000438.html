How did you determine that Eclipse &quot;usually links the resources to
/usr/lib libraries&quot;?

Those are likely for your desktop machine, unless you have installed
the Android version of OSG there. If you are using the Eclipse Android
development plugin, it will not touch those - different architecture
and all. It wouldn't even link if you were mixing architectures.

&gt;<i> Because there are no compilation complains and because the

</I>
Uhm, how did you figure this out? I am quite not following, to be
honest. If your plugins are missing and they are compiled as dynamic,
for whatever reason, you *will not* get a compilation/linking error!

&gt;<i> Question is: How do I tell the Android eclipse builder to link all

</I>&gt;<i> location and NOT to get them from the global /usr/lib location ? I

</I>
You need to modify the Android.mk file in your jni directory normally.
That's where you specify where the dependencies are and what to link.
Eclipse doesn't do any magic there - it just calls ndk-build and that
one in turn calls make.

However, I do feel that you have quite a mess on your workstation - I
would strongly suggest to remove all the various versions of OSG (e.g.
move them out of the way, rename them, etc.) to make sure you have
only the Android one present. And then try to build the thing.

Best regards,

J.
