<PRE>Hi Chris,

My first reaction is WTF, second, third, I mean WTF?!?

What I don't understand is that will only list you if you are
officially the main distributor.  I guess I could understand they'd
want some kinda of official clarification for the relationship to the
main OSG project and that the binaries are &quot;sanctioned&quot;, but having
the potential for multiple sanctioned sources can be a bonus.

I'm happy to be referenced in discussions.

Robert.

</I>&gt;<i>   It seems to me like Google somehow, doesn't even GET the idea of Open
