The head of the master branch is currently supporting the v0.5.0.1 of Oculus SDK. The work with v0.6.0.0 is currently located in a separate branch. I have not decided yet on how to proceed with the branches. I usually tag the last working commit of an SDK version before pushing commits belonging to a new SDK version. But since Linux and Mac will be abandoned, it may be a demand for a separate branch for the continuous development based on SDK v0.5.0.1. 

I will keep the idea in mind...

</I>

Well, I guess they believe that reducing the number of accessible parts of the SDK makes the product easier to integrate. BUT as they keep closing the SDK they also reduces the ways people can use the product. They seem 100% focused on (windows) games (which maybe the smart business decision), but they leave out the people how like to hack stuff and create solutions which no one at Oculus Inc. imagined. 

Hopefully the competition will benefit the HMD manufacturer which is most open, but I guess that the winner will be the one who can provide &quot;the killer application&quot; (or in this case; &quot;the killer game&quot;).
