<PRE>Hi Robert,

thanks for the fast reply. And I agree with you.

My call was more for those in the community that have experience with this
and are willing to share. In the last couple of years I worked with
commercial software (at least two big names, like Oktal, TrianGraphics) and
the core for their products is OSG and their work is just something (at
least to some small degree) I am after. I know, this might be naive to
expect from someone to give hints from their IP, but you never know.

Also, I am in a role of consultant for this so there might be a budget
(?-really can not say at this moment), to have some stable light-weight osg
constrained triangulation. I like it as is, really, simple thin interface,
just a bit complex to chase bugs in there :-) ....

I think this topic will be actuall in the next couple of months.

Thanks anyway !

Nick

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; over the last 2 years I was working for a client on prototyping

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now on the same topic again, and it is for real apps (OSG based) not
</I>&gt;<i> prototyping. And I need error free constrained triangulation. The one in
</I>&gt;<i> OSG gives me results like in the attached images (holes etc). I tried to
</I>&gt;<i> look at this CGAL lib but found it over-complicated (for me) to use and I
</I>&gt;<i> do prefer to stick with what we have in OSG. Anyone with some hints on
</I>&gt;<i> maybe how to work with complex constraints and osg delaunay? My code is
</I>&gt;<i> based on the depricated osgdelaunay example. Maybe something extra? Any
</I>&gt;<i> word will help!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks a bunch as always!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
