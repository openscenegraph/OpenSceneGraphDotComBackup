That exactly the same can be said for the OSG.  Doesn't mean

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is down to the weakness of the alternatives rather as much as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; strength of Qt.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - It's actively developed using the latest C++11/14 standards and supported by both a commercial organization and a robust LGPL community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Will they get rid of the non standard C++ extensions and pre-compiling nonsense?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - Is has a new lease of life through PyQT5 and PySide being the 'de-facto' way to build Python based desktop UI's.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - QML is quite interesting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is simply too much pushed into Qt over the years. The lack of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; focus on the core functionality hurts it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I say this from experience, we've pushed too much functionality into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the OpenSceneGraph distribution over the years, I can see the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mistakes, but with backwards compatibility being an important factor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for end users it's not easy to just make radical changes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What the computer industry is a nice neat, small C++11 UI library with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; good hooks to building scripting integration on top of.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't know why QT and OSG seem to fight each other so much, but it seems a PITA to get things working properly as the OP and I have both found mysterious issues popping up that require trips into the debugger and the QT and OSG source. I had to advocate for OSG as other developers were keen to use QT3D instead.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OSG integration with 3rd party windowing toolkits has generally been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pretty straight forward - once the basics have been written it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take much to update and keep things working.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our experience with Qt is not like this at all.  X11, Win32 they've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been pretty rock solid for way over a decade now.  OSX has required
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jumping through a hoops because Apple doesn't care about developers as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much as it cares about vendor lock-in.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Over the years the OSG hasn't added extra burden on the 3rd party
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; windowing toolkits, it's exactly the same as it has always been, just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; create a GL context and allow the OSG to call makeCurrent() and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; swapBuffers and we are pretty well done.  It *should* be simple.  It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is requires is the 3rd party windowing toolkit not to screw around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with things. It's Qt screwing around with things that is breaking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things, they have lost sight of what the Windowing API should be doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and trading on the toes of application develop codes/3rd party SDK's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like the OSG.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Qt *is* broken in this respect. It really should be down to the Qt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support to help you work out how to fix this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It terms of thinking about migrating away from OpenSceneGraph to Qt3D,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this might solve the Qt integration issue, but it just further cements
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the lock-in to Qt, you'll end up tied to their future success or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; failures.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The future of scene graphs isn't OpenGL/OpenGL ES, it's Vulkan, so if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you really want to migrate to another scene graph then it should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Vulkan based if you want it to be future proofed.  Qt3D might be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ported to Vulkan, but it'll still be tied to Qt and all the baggage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that goes with it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Modern computing should be based around well designed and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functionality focused components that can be mixed and matched as to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the needs of the applications.  One stop shop SDK's and vendors that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; try to give you solutions for a wide range of functionality will give
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you lowest common denominator solutions rather than best of breed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This philosophy isn't Qt specific, but is something that I feel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers should bare in mind when considering what tools to use and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deeply they should tie themselves to them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
