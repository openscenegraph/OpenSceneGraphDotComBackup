Well done, baby steps, keep at it and you'll get further and faster.

</I>&gt;<i> Robert, what time did it take you to cover 71 miles?
</I>
11hrs to complete the first 50 miles, then a sleep and then hit by
stomach problems which reduced me to a walk to try and get things back
on track.  Alas didn't work so had to pull out at 71miles. I think it
was about 19hrs.

My best time for the full 95 miles of the race is 20:18.  Course
record is a crazy 13:41.  It's through the highlands so it's far from
flat, is a mostly stony rough trail with around 10,000ft of
ascent/descent.

Cheers,
Robert.
