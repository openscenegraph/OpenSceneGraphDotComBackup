I haven't seen him post for quite a few years.  I believe osgOcean was
related to a university research project, folk move on.

&gt;<i> This should prob be in another post, but anyway. When using the primitives such as sphere, box etc in OSG 3.6 they don't respond to changing position, size etc. Works fine in 3.4.
</I>
In 3.6 the osg::ShapeDrawable is now implemented as an osg::Geometry,
broadly it should work the same, if there is a usage case that it
isn't working the same could you create a small test example (such as
modifying an existing OSG example) to illustrate the problem, it could
well be a bug that we can fix once we know what might be amiss.

Cheers,
Robert.
