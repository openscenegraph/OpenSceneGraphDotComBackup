<PRE>Thanks for clafirications, I will give it another try.

Yeah, of course I don't expect everything to be superoptimized either. As mentioned I did managed to build each and every one manually as instructed by original libraries, and some with a bit of hacking (giflib). But I wish I could automate everything. Goal is to be able to fire up a batch script, get srcs from github (or with wget), configure everything and build without need to open any gui tool such as cmake. 

When building with your cmakes I have tryed pretty much what you describe. 1st i downloaded all code for every project in their respective folder, than I put your cmake files in the respective folder and top level one in top level directory where all other src folders were. I than opened cmake-gui and configured stuff for tope-level project, but it didn't build individual projects. Prospect of configuring manually each and every one did occur to me but I have to admiit, not overly appealing :). 

Now from your answer I understand  I should do some extra work to tell your cmake from my batch file where to find things. That is probably reason why I got only project files for &quot;build all&quot; and &quot;install&quot; but not individual project files.

The ting is I already have a batch script that will automaticly configure cmake variables depending on what compiler is present in my path, bitness and paths where I want stuff to build in and to install to, compiler flags etc. It works often time &quot;out of the box so to say&quot;, but sometimes there are such cases as this where I have to figure out extra things to make it work.

Just fooling around with nick, my real name is as strange as nick, you wouldn't believe me anyway :).

Thanks for answer and best regards
