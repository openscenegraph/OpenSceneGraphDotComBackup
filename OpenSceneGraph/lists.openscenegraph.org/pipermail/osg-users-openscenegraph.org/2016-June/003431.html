<PRE>Really cool Robert.  I'd love to get TravisCI setup for osgEarth as well,
we might pick your brain on it here soon.

&gt;<i> With help form Ralf Habacker and Jordi Torress we now have Travis
</I>&gt;<i> build testing and Coverity scan up and running.  If you got to the
</I>&gt;<i> OSG's github page :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and look down to the README.md you'll see two little bullet icons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   [build | passing]  [ coverity | passed 5 new defects]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can click on the build icon and it'll take you to the Travis build
</I>&gt;<i> logs, and click on the Coverity one and it'll take you to our new
</I>&gt;<i> Coverity analysis page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the up coming OpenSceneGraph-3.6 stable release I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> improve the Coverity defect count. I have already made dozens of small
</I>&gt;<i> fixes to code highlight by Coverity, there is still a long way to go.
</I>&gt;<i> For this effort I'd appreciate help from the community :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My personally priority is to squash the High priority ones first, then
</I>&gt;<i> move on to Midium and then lower priority ones.  Also defects picked
</I>&gt;<i> up in the core libraries like osg, osgUtil, osgDB, osgGA, osgViewer
</I>&gt;<i> are ones that will benefit the most users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As well as code fixes just reviewing the defect reports and accessing
</I>&gt;<i> how crucial it is would be helpful.  The Coverity web interface allows
</I>&gt;<i> you to add comments as well as adjust properties/categorization of
</I>&gt;<i> defects.  For this you'll need to either log into via your Github
</I>&gt;<i> account or create a Coverity account.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As work on cleaning up defects progresses I will apply the fixes to
</I>&gt;<i> master as they come in and then every couple of days merge these
</I>&gt;<i> changes as a block to the new coverity_scan branch which will then
</I>&gt;<i> fire off a Coverity scan so we can get an update of how the clean up
</I>&gt;<i> is progressing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When doing fixes please make sure that you fully understand the code
</I>&gt;<i> you are modifying and the nature of the defect.  It's all too easy to
</I>&gt;<i> fix a warning/defect report on code that was working fine and then
</I>&gt;<i> have the new &quot;improved&quot; code introduce a bug that neither produces
</I>&gt;<i> warning or a Coverity scan.  I say this as I have made this mistake
</I>&gt;<i> myself before, and also spotted such mistakes when merging changes
</I>&gt;<i> from others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for you help,
</I>&gt;<i> Robert.
