<PRE>Hi All,

I have tagged the OpenSceneGraph-3.5.3 developer release, a
significant milestone towards the stable 3.6.0 that I'll make this
summer.

The github tag is:

    <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.5.3">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.5.3</A>

I haven't had a chance to update the website yet, it's evening here
and have a busy weekend so won't have a chance to update it so this
will have to wait till next week.

Changes?  Well lots, mostly minor though, things like build, runtime
and warning/coverity fixes.  Can't think of any major features off the
top of my head but then I'm tired and have lots of other things to get
on with this evening so you'll have to read the ChangeLog.  Oh support
for glMultiDrawArrays/osg::MultiDrawArrays will be one for those who
want to squeeze that extra bit of performance out.

Thanks to all those who've contributed to testing, fixes and new features.

Cheers,
Robert.

it's easier to see how the two variables are coupled.

modifications to Viewer.cpp and reformated them slightly to avoid a
double check against getSceneData()!=0 and then rolled
the changes out to CompositeViewer::checkNeedToDoFrame() to ensure
that both implementations work the same.

I am hereby submitting a deferred rendering code sample, originally
written by Michael Kapelko in 2013. I am submitting this code with his
approval.Deferred rendering is now the de-facto standard rendering
technique in many modern game engines, hence I think it is important
to have this technique demonstrated in an osg code example.

This particular sample adds soft shadows as well as bump mapping into
the rendering pipeline. The image files whitemetal_diffuse.jpg and
whitemetal_normal.jpg from OpenSceneGraph-Data images folder are
required (The OSG_FILE_PATH environment variable must be set
correctly)

Two additional osgt models are included with the demo (best to also
put them into OpenSceneGraph-Data, I think.

The shaders are currently defined in separate .frag and .vert files.

As part of the new functionality there is now a
osg::GraphicsContext::Traits::windowingSystemPreferrence string
that default to empty, but if defined will ensure that a specific
WindowingSystemInterface is utilized when
you do a generic call like osg::createGraphicsContext().

Also implemented is standard proxy object for registering the new
contexts and removing them automatically, and
declaration of standard graphicswindow_name() C entry point to help
with static build linking.

Fixed ShaderComposer::releaseGLObjects(State*) const method as it's

const method to pass on the releaseGLObjects() calls to any associated
Program or Shader objects.

Added support for invoked an editor defined by P3D_EDITOR or EDITOR
env vars when user press 'U' in Present3D. This feature makes it
easier to editor an presentation that is already running in Present3D,
once the edits are done pressing 'u' in Present3D then loads the file
again.

&gt;<i>From Jannik Heller, Wrong function call in setTextureAttributeAndModes
</I>&quot;From I think that this piece of code in
StateSet::setTextureAttributeAndModes is a copy&amp;paste mistake:
   OSG_NOTICE&lt;&lt;&quot;Warning: non texture attribute
'&quot;&lt;&lt;attribute-&gt;className()&lt;&lt;&quot;' passed to
setTextureAttributeAndModes(unit,attr,value), &quot;&lt;&lt;std::endl;
            OSG_NOTICE&lt;&lt;&quot;         assuming
setAttributeAndModes(attr,value) instead.&quot;&lt;&lt;std::endl;
            OSG_NOTICE&lt;&lt;&quot;         please change calling code to use
appropriate call.&quot;&lt;&lt;std::endl;
            setAttribute(attribute,value);

As per the warning message it should be calling
setAttributeAndModes(attribute,value); .&quot;

Added a local implementation of
SlideEventHandler::checkNeedToDoFrame() so that Present3D can toggle
on/off the need for continuous rendering to only slides that require
it, enabling slides with no animation to sit iddle rather keeping
rendering, reducing CPU/GPU overhead and saving power.

&gt;<i>From Joe Thompson, &quot;OpenSceneGraph cannot be built with Visual Studio
</I>2008. The file osg-OpenSceneGraph-3.4.0\include\osg\Types typedefs
int8_t, int16_t, int32_t and int64_t These are typedefed as signed
__intX in several other places. With VS2008, this causes an error
&quot;int8_t redifined, different basic types&quot; Explicitly declaring them
signed fixes the error.&quot;
