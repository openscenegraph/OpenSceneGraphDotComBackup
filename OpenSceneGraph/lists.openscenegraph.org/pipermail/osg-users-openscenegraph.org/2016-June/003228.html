<PRE>Hi Carl-Gustaf Kung, 

I wrote the CMake scripts to be able to quickly build the dependencies upon which I project I was working on was using. Then I added some more libraries by request. Are these scripts totally optimized for every platform? No. They should be used as a quick way of getting the dependencies built and assembled into a directory for easy use with OSG. If you desire total control of every tiny setting for each library I recommend that you do a separate build for each library with settings that match your platform.

That said, this is how you use the CMake scripts:

1. Download or Clone the CMake script from the GitHub repo.

2. Download the sources for each library you desire to build. You can put these anywhere on your filesystem. Download locations for each library can be found in the Readme file.

3. Start the CMake GUI:
- In the field &quot;Where is the source code&quot; you enter the directory for the CMake scripts. 
- In the field &quot;Where to build the binaries&quot; you enter where you desire the Visual Studio project files to end up. I 

4. Press &quot;Configure&quot; in the CMake GUI. This will reveal a couple of directories which you need to specify. These all end with _SOURCE_DIR. For these you specify the location of the libraries which you downloaded in step 2. 

5. Press &quot;Configure&quot; a couple of more times. Depending on which libraries you are building more or less options will be shown in the CMake GUI.

6. When happy, press &quot;Generate&quot;. This will construct the solution file and project files for Visual Studio in the specified binaries directory.

7. Open the solution file and build the &quot;ALL_BUILD&quot; project.

8. When complete, build the &quot;INSTALL&quot; project. This will create a directory in your binary directory named &quot;3rdParty&quot; inside this directory another directory will be created which matches your Visual Studio version and selected architecture (i.e. 32 or 64 bit build). In this directory there will be the lib, include and bin directories. Note that you need to build the &quot;INSTALL&quot; project twice, once for Debug build and once for Release. Or else the 3rdParty directory will be missing the corresponding files.

Good luck!

Nice username by the way. :)

Regards,
Bj&#246;rn
