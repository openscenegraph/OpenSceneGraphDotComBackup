</I>That's not entirely correct. I asked for something like this some years 
ago to implement a per-object motion blur in a deferred pipeline.
Basically one would write per-fragment velocity vectors to a render 
target to later selectively blur in a post-processing step. The velocity 
vectors were based on the change in the view-matrix + the changes per 
object.
I remember experimenting with callbacks and holding the last 
model-matrix in the objects user-data which was used to fill an uniform 
each frame, but I ultimately switched to a solution which didn't 
consider the blur on a per-object base.
So basically there are use-cases, but I never found a satisfactory 
solution (I think the problem was performance, due to the many uniform 
updates/statesets).
May be there is a more advanced solution to the problem that haven't 
thought of.

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> One thing to also considering in your pondering is that not all
</I>&gt;<i> objects will actually be in the view frustum over subsequent frames,
</I>&gt;<i> especially as you pan around, new objects will appear in the view
</I>&gt;<i> frustum for the first time so won't have a previous modelview matrix
</I>&gt;<i> associated with them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since you haven't said what this is all in aid of I can't say whether
</I>&gt;<i> this later issue has any baring, it will however, if you really need
</I>&gt;<i> to do what you say you need to do will introduce it's own set of
</I>&gt;<i> issues.
