<PRE>Hi All,

We recently got Coverity scan up and running against the OSG, I'll
write separately on this effort, but for this thread is that Coverity
has picked out a few plugins that are written in a rather hacky way,
one example of is the dw (Designed Workbench) plugin.

This plugin was written back in the very earliest days of the OSG, so
it's over 15 years old, most of the changes to it since have been
changes to comply with changes in the core OSG or warning
fixes/portability fixes/Coverity fixes.  The last one that looked to
show active development was in 2006.

I haven't seen any discussion about people actively using the DW
plugin in the last decade.  If no one is using there there is no point
it clogging up the OSG code base, and no point me trying to fix
Coverity defacts in it.  The code is an ugly mess so it not something
I'd ever want anyone to see as an example of how to code modern C++
applications.

So... feedback, if can see any reason to keep the DW plugin speak up
now, otherwise I'll remove it for git master so it won't make it into
OSG-3.6.

Thanks in advance for your feedback,
Robert.
