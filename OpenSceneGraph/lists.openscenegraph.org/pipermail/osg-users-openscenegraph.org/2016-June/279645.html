<PRE>With help form Ralf Habacker and Jordi Torress we now have Travis
build testing and Coverity scan up and running.  If you got to the
OSG's github page :

   <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph</A>

and look down to the README.md you'll see two little bullet icons:

  [build | passing]  [ coverity | passed 5 new defects]

You can click on the build icon and it'll take you to the Travis build
logs, and click on the Coverity one and it'll take you to our new
Coverity analysis page.

For the up coming OpenSceneGraph-3.6 stable release I would like to
improve the Coverity defect count. I have already made dozens of small
fixes to code highlight by Coverity, there is still a long way to go.
For this effort I'd appreciate help from the community :-)

My personally priority is to squash the High priority ones first, then
move on to Midium and then lower priority ones.  Also defects picked
up in the core libraries like osg, osgUtil, osgDB, osgGA, osgViewer
are ones that will benefit the most users.

As well as code fixes just reviewing the defect reports and accessing
how crucial it is would be helpful.  The Coverity web interface allows
you to add comments as well as adjust properties/categorization of
defects.  For this you'll need to either log into via your Github
account or create a Coverity account.

As work on cleaning up defects progresses I will apply the fixes to
master as they come in and then every couple of days merge these
changes as a block to the new coverity_scan branch which will then
fire off a Coverity scan so we can get an update of how the clean up
is progressing.

When doing fixes please make sure that you fully understand the code
you are modifying and the nature of the defect.  It's all too easy to
fix a warning/defect report on code that was working fine and then
have the new &quot;improved&quot; code introduce a bug that neither produces
warning or a Coverity scan.  I say this as I have made this mistake
myself before, and also spotted such mistakes when merging changes
from others.

Thanks in advance for you help,
Robert.
