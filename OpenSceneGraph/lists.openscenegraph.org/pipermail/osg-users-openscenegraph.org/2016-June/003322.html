It is an old *nix file and is not impossible that you got it with some other project. I reinstalled windows like day before I did build, so I have built on pretty clean system.
</I>

Tried this a minute ago. I do not get the same warning for giflib (the missing strings.h warning). 

I did a web search for the problem and found this blog post from Microsoft:
<A HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2015/03/03/introducing-the-universal-crt/">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2015/03/03/introducing-the-universal-crt/</A>

So these libraries are now installed separately, which I must have done. But it is strange that your compiler only complains about string.h. There are other header files used in giflib which also are included from the universal CRT folder. It should complain about all the others as well.

Anyhow, maybe we should change something to make this work on a clean installed machine (i.e. Visual Studio only). Or at least write something in the readme that the universal CRT are required to build giflib.

</I>

Building cUrl or any of the other dependencies manually is always an option. But my goal was to automate the most common dependencies. Original I did not include cUrl, but as it was sent to me as a working pull request I saw no problem with including it. But of course if any of the libraries start to be hard to maintain I may be forced to remove them.

Regretfully it is not an option to just link to the CMake file inside the cUrl project. That CMake file expects cUrl to be the only project, so it would not work if included inside the osg-3rdparty-cmake scripts. Maybe it could be done using some form of custom target script, but that is something I do not have time to write just now. But I would gladly merge any Pull Request which offered this functionality.
