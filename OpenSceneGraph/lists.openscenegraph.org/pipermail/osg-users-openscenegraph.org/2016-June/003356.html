<PRE>Hello Fran&#231;ois,

</I>&gt;<i> The build displays a few warnings, but no error. See attached build log

</I>&gt;<i> I think that the normal unix way to point to shared libraries that are

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I mainly work on windows, so I had to look that up when I was trying to
solve the &quot;image not loaded&quot; error when running osgviewer. I came across a
post *somewhere* that for development purposes it's wiser to us
&quot;DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;
and not interfere with &quot;DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;. It's supposed to do what the
name implies: &quot;use this if all else fails...&quot;. But I know it's a hack.

...so, I don't understand your &quot;implicit instantiation&quot; errors. Is this
&gt;<i> related to the Xcode 7.3.1 update? Did you play with your c++ library
</I>&gt;<i> somehow?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
:<i>) I did not play with my c++ library!
</I>Seriously, no. But searching around for this problem gave many results that
point to a transition from using gcc to clang in Xcode and the difference
between using libstdc++ and libc++ as the standard library (for example:
<A HREF="https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/19">https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/19</A>). Does that mean anything to you? On
the other hand, that transition was made a few releases ago so I would
expect you to get the same error if that were the reason.
But anyway, since &quot;ref_ptr&quot; doesn't #include &lt;string&gt; it was apparently
relying on an implicit #include *somewhere else*, so it must be that with
my setup that no longer happens. Sadly I haven't got the time right now to
track it down further...
