<PRE>Hi Robert,

Sorry for the delay -- it took a few go-rounds to get this in the shape that CMake folks wanted it.

This is what I have submitted to CMake with a few necessary tweaks:
. Full copyright text that they require when not shipped with CMake
. include statement tweak to work when not within CMake

If you want this to go the osg-submissions let me know.

This missed the CMake 3.6 freeze so it probably won't be released for a bit but this version should hold us until then. I'll try to remember to check for the patch in future CMake releases and let you know when the custom version is no longer required.

Wrt the freetype build, it seems they have already eliminated the build modifying headers in the source tree (or the need to copy the changes into it) and I confirmed that with freetype 2.6.3. So as long as we assume OSG 3rd party lib builders are using fresh lib versions we don't need a wiki note about that gotcha.

Cheers,
Stuart

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Wrt the PNG on/off issue, I now understand the approach they use. The upshot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is that as long as you refresh the freetype source tree you are building
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with from the original code before each build you can switch PNG support on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or off in the cmake command with -DWITH_PNG=ON or OFF and without manually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> editing ftoption.h. (Same holds for ZLIB support.) The reason is that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build goes in and modifies ftoption.h in the source tree (as well as making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a copy in the build tree) and the modification only uncomments those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defines, so you can't build with PNG enabled and then PNG disabled without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> refreshing the source first. This is an unfortunate approach but that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what we are stuck with. Most builders don't switch the PNG or ZLIB support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on and off so this probably doesn't often trip people up. The best we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably do is add a note on an appropriate wiki page. I added this refresh
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> step to my build scripts.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> builder but it would be good if the CMakeLists.txt could handle both
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> situations without needing changes like I made.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The freetype build headers under include\freetype2\freetype even though
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> freetype doesn't use that freetype2 layer anymore. Not a big deal since OSG
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't really need to ship with freetype or other 3rd party lib headers.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The debug build is able to build freetype with the same mods but the OSG
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> build doesn't find it:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> -- Could NOT find Freetype (missing:  FREETYPE_LIBRARY) (found version
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;2.6.3&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which I assume is due to not looking for the name freetyped, as I found
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with my OSG 3.4.0 build. So the OSG build can complete but it won't build
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the freetype plugin.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The debug build fails at &quot;Installing the project...&quot; because it appears
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> something is wrong with the new pdb installation support:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> -- Installing: C:/OSG.VC.xd/bin/osgd.dll
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> CMake Error at src/osg/cmake_install.cmake:39 (file):
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    file INSTALL cannot find
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    &quot;C:/Projects/OSG/VC.xd/OSG/src/osg/PREFIX-NOTFOUNDosgd.pdb&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Call Stack (most recent call first):
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    src/cmake_install.cmake:33 (include)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    cmake_install.cmake:100 (include)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The osgd.pdb file is present and next to osgd.dll as expected.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I see that others are reporting success with the Visual C++ 2015 build but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know how they are addressing the freetype PNG issues or if they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tried the debug build yet. It looks like there are still some issues but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> maybe they will offer some input here. I'm happy to make another pass if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that helps.

# Created by Eric Wing.
# Modifications by Alexander Neundorf.
# This file has been renamed to &quot;FindFreetype.cmake&quot; instead of the correct
# &quot;FindFreeType.cmake&quot; in order to be compatible with the one from KDE4, Alex.

# Ugh, FreeType seems to use some #include trickery which
# makes this harder than it should be. It looks like they
# put ft2build.h in a common/easier-to-find location which
# then contains a #include to a more specific header in a
# more specific location (#include &lt;freetype/config/ftheader.h&gt;).
# Then from there, they need to set a bunch of #define's
# so you can do something like:
# #include FT_FREETYPE_H
# Unfortunately, using CMake's mechanisms like include_directories()
# wants explicit full paths and this trickery doesn't work too well.
# I'm going to attempt to cut out the middleman and hope
# everything still works.

# Adapted for OpenSceneGraph until the updates here for finding the debug Windows library freetyped are released with CMake
