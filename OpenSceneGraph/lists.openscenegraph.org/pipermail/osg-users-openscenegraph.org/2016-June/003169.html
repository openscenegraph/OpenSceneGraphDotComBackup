<PRE>Hi Stuart,

Thanks for the modified file.  I've just reviewed this, as is it would
break the build for others as you remove paths from the search list
rather than just add a new one.  The addition of the debug library is
desirable but would raise the issue of mixing debug and release libs,
something that the present ones do in the opposite direction so the
original script isn't ideal on this either.

I can easily insert your additions into the OSG's FindFreetype.cmake,
however, I do wonder if it's not best now to just adopt CMake's own
FindFreetype.cmake.  CMake has come along way since the early days
when we adopted and it's own list of Find scripts was lacking.

I will have a bash with removing the OSG's FindFreetype.cmake so the
it utilizes CMake own version, if this works well I'll check it in to
git master.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am doing Windows builds with VC++ 2015 and latest build from sources of the 3rd party libraries. A few issues with the current freetype lib cause the build to fail and we want to get the right patches to support different versions of freetype. The 2 issues are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The include path structure doesn't have a freeetype2 directory anymore so the stock FindFreetype.cmake isn't working. In the attached FindFreetype.cmake I just hacked it to work with the new layout but that obviously won't work for the old layout. Does some CMake guru know the right way to do this? Would it work to just drop the OSG custom FindFreetype.cmake and use the CMake one (which seems to have both include/freetype2 and include supported in the latest CMake)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The debug build doesn't find freetyped.lib because freetyped isn't in the NAMES list. I added freetyped to NAMES but if that isn't the right/safe way to do it it would be helpful to hear a better idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you!
