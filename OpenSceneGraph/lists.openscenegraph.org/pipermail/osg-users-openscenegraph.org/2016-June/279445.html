<PRE>Hi,

In a true necromancer fashion I would like to resurrect this thread, since I need some help with Bj&#246;rn's scripts. 

I managed to compile OSG from scratch, inclusive all 3rd party libraries. I have used VS2015, a x64 build, and all 3rd party libs are also compiled by me as 64-bit shared libraries. I have generally followed build instructions and methods as much as possible as provided by the respective library. In some cases I have cooked my own (giflib notably, zlib). Curl was really picky to get a dll with OpenSSL. 

Anyway, I did stumbled upon Bj&#246;rn's CMake files, but I couldn't got them to work. I am not sure if I have got it right? I am suppose to downolad 3rd party sources and place your cmake files in respective folder? I have tried that, but it didn't worked for me. It was 2 days ago I tryed it, so I don't remember the errors I got. 

I would like to be able to use Bj&#246;rn's cmakes, since it took me quite while to figure out each one library and build method on it's own. Havin'g those makefiles would also make it possible for me to write a batch file to update and build things automatically instead of me doing each and every manually.

I'm quite sure I just qoofed it up somewhere and I would be really helpful for help.

I also wonder if somebody has compiled Collada 2.4, with vs2015 for 64 bit arch, I am a bit stuck with it.

Best regards &amp; thank you!
