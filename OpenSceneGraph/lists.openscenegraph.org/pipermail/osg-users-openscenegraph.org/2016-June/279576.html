<PRE>Hello,

I'm new to OSG and to this list, so I'm not sure how appropriate this post
is, but I'm hoping somebody will find it useful. Following are some notes
about the process I went through to build OSG on my new Macbook Pro.

Mac OS X 10.11.5
CMake 3.5.2
Xcode 7.3.1
OSG git clone, &quot;git rev-parse HEAD&quot; returns
157ee3dd7d080e7b16b133dabab9f8dce2f83941

When configuring with cmake I get the following warning:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CMake Warning (dev):
  Policy CMP0042 is not set: MACOSX_RPATH is enabled by default.  Run &quot;cmake
  --help-policy CMP0042&quot; for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command
to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

  MACOSX_RPATH is not specified for the following targets:

   OpenThreads
   osg
   osgAnimation
   osgDB
   osgFX
   osgGA
   osgManipulator
   osgParticle
   osgPresentation
   osgShadow
   osgSim
   osgTerrain
   osgText
   osgUI
   osgUtil
   osgViewer
   osgVolume
   osgWidget
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(I'm not installing to a default path)

When running make I get the following errors:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changing &quot;OpenSceneGraph/include/osg/ref_ptr&quot; by adding &quot;#include &lt;string&gt;&quot;
seems to solve this.
Next run builds OSG, but with following warnings:

Built successfully!

&quot;make install&quot; gave me some trouble because I didn't know that cmake
doesn't expand &quot;~&quot;, but that was easily solved.

Next I had to do: &quot;export
DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/wja/projects/bin/osg/lib&quot;.
And now I can see a shiny silver cow with &quot;osgviewer&quot;!

I suppose that the DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH hack can be avoided with a
better configuration in CMakeCache.txt, but I haven't taken time to figure
that out yet.

If anybody can point out what I did wrong to have to include &lt;string&gt; in
the file ref_ptr I would be grateful.

And now I can't wait to get started with OSG!
