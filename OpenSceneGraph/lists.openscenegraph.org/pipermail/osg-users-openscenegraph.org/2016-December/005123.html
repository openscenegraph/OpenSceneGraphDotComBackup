<PRE>Hi Bruce,

Just from top of my head.

1. Check and verify if all osgXXX.dll and OpenThreads.dll are loaded from
correct installation directories. Similar errors often occur if
Debug/Release/Rev libs get mixed. VS Output pane displays all loaded DLLs
with long paths so its easy to verify if some lib was not picked from other
path.

2. Check if Call stack does not show some crashes in Nvidia OpenGL threads.
Sometimes errors there affect the other threads which invoked OpenGL calls.
Also check NVidia Control Panel. There is Multithreaded Optimization
setting (actual names may vary a little as I am using my localized language
version and cannot check them in English). Experiment with it. Perhaps one
of the options will fix the problem.

3. I checked the version of OSG I have installed on my machine currently
(OSG 3.4.0). osgViewer does not crash with cessna in dual screen
(Window10/GTX 1080 drivers 375.95). But it is 64 bit build. So your 32 bit
results may still vary.

Cheers,
Wojtek Lewandowski

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first I tried using the OSG_MULTIMONITOR_WIN32_NVIDIA_WORKAROUND flag.

</I>&gt;<i> display and other times ran fine.  It we still to unstable to leave in this
</I>&gt;<i> configuration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've just looked at the history of GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp, the
</I>&gt;<i> OSG_MULTIMONITOR_WIN32_NVIDIA_WORKAROUND is a workaround for an NVidia
</I>&gt;<i> driver bug from 8 years ago, I'd hope that it's no longer relevant...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/commit/">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/commit/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 7c23951ee17ab444220220951dae16df7c691e2a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; next I turned off the flag set in the previous step  and tried the
</I>&gt;<i> BUILD_OPENTHREADS_WITH_QT flag and rebuilt the package.  With this
</I>&gt;<i> configuration, osgViewer never crashed but some of the other / larger apps
</I>&gt;<i> still crashed.   I can not name those that crashed or where they crashed at
</I>&gt;<i> this moment because I am installing Visual Studio 2015 and the installer
</I>&gt;<i> won't let me run any version of Visual Studio while it is doing a setup.
</I>&gt;<i> It did still point towards a threading problem though.  I can check
</I>&gt;<i> tomorrow when the install is finished.  Hope this sheds some light on the
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  I will try vs2015 tomorrow as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The effect of shifting the BUILD_OPENTHREADS_WITH_QT suggests a either
</I>&gt;<i> that the bug is timing sensitive or the OpenThreads::Win32 implement
</I>&gt;<i> is not protecting threads as it should be.  It may be worth looking at
</I>&gt;<i> the differences between OSG-3.2 and 3.4 w.r.t OpenThreads, perhaps one
</I>&gt;<i> of the &quot;fixes&quot; has actually caused a regression.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any non NVidia or non Windows setups?
