<PRE>Hi Bruce,

I am surprised that this is an issue, the OSG has long been able to
run multi-threaded across multiple monitors, it's a fundamental part
of the OSG design.  I don't personally use Windows too often so there
might be a Windows specific issue that others under Windows didn't
pick up on the OSG-3.4 pre-release cycle.  I would have expected
others to flag up the issue as well.  Given this I don't have any
straight forward explanation to why it might be happening.

The stack trace doesn't really provide much insight to what is going
wrong unfortunately. Is it actually crashing in ref_optr&lt;&gt;?

Does it rendering any frames before crashing?

Did you build the OSG with defaults or adjust the settings for a
particular set of preferences?

Does multi-montior but single graphics card fail?

What has been your experience with other OSG version? I.e. did 3.2
fail in the same way as well?  Have you tried git master?

Robert.

</I>&gt;<i> whereas at work it is always crash at the osg::Group traverse.  I will send a stack trace from there tomorrow.  At home I am running on Windows 7 Professional with an AMD Phenom II 6X 1090T and I have two Nvidia 550 graphics cards.  The work system is an 8 core Dell laptop running Windows 7.  but if I force it to single threaded it does not crash even will all of the monitors on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have also tried various other work systems some with Windows 7 and others windows 10 but I did not have a compiler that I could use for debugging on those systems so I don't know for sure where it crashed just that it did if I do not use SingleThreaded
