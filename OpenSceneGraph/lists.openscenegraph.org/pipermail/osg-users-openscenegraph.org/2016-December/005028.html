You are doing so many odd things in your code, it's really hard to
tell you where to start.  You've been quite a bit of suggestions on
how to do stuff over the past few weeks yet none of it's been used
here.  I suspect there are things are a fundamental level that you are
missing.  You've got the handling of event wrong, you've got a bizarre
usage of projection node and your own lat/long matrix setup that leave
me wonder what on earth you actually trying to achieve.

There are plenty of OSG examples, find one that is closest to what you
need to do.  The osgpick, osgkeyboardmouse, osgsimulation etc. Spend
time with the examples, spend time looking at the headers of the
classes that these examples use.  Once you understand these example
then have a think about what you are trying to achieve in your own
application.

Robert.
