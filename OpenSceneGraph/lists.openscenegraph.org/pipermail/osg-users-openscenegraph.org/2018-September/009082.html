<PRE>I think some parts were lost in translation. I think the word you want to
use is &quot;eraser&quot; instead of &quot;rubber&quot;, though I can see how it could be
mistranslated from another language.

I can think of a way to do this with your current draw order (black line
then green line) by using a shader and a texture holding the background
image.

Otherwise, you'd have to probably change the draw order so that the black
line was drawn later than the green line.


I often recommend users with complex questions &quot;take a step back&quot; and
explain the non-simple-abstract problem. Many times we find people asking a
specific question believing it is the only solution, and finding no good
ways to achieve it, when in fact the same overall goal could easily be
accomplished a different way if we knew what they were really trying to do.

Could you explain more about the real-world problem you're trying to solve,
instead of this simplified abstract summary?

As an example, imagine if someone came to you asking how to safely operate
a flamethrower in their kitchen, and you answered it was impossible. Later
you found out that all they wanted to do was make tea, but had pre-decided
on &quot;flamethrower&quot; as the way to get there, but if they'd just said &quot;I want
to make tea&quot;, an electric kettle would have neatly solved the problem.
Don't be the flamethrower tea guy.
