<PRE>Hi Lonni,

Laurens suggested fix is what I would have suggested too so I'd
recommend you just apply these locally.

For updating to the latest version, given that you are jumping from
3.01 to 3.6.x would be a big jump.  Both are still part of 3.x series
so broadly similar w.r.t public API, so for the most part I would
expect a recompile to be sufficient.  It's still a long period though
so there are lots changes to the interface, implementations, as
additional features or features refactored.

If you do the big jump and just find a few problems then just let us
know what issues you have and we may be able to point you in the right
direction to resolve them.   If the big jump introduces too many
issues then perhaps jumping to 3.2.x first, get things working, then
jump to 3.4.x then finally to 3.6.x might be easier.  Or if you are
lucky then just jumping to 3.4.x would be an easy enough step.

As a general note, few users now use 3.0.x so there hasn't been any
activity within the OSG community to support it, for the last couple
of years the main focus has been on 3.4.x and 3.6.x.  Build and bug
fixes have all focused on there two stable release series.  I'm pretty
confident that 3.6.3 is the best release we've made so once you've
made the leap and got things working there it should be a much more
stable base - and any issues found by the community will be wrapped up
and pushed out as subsequent minor point releases, so you'll be able
to benefit from these too.

Cheers,
Robert.
</PRE>
