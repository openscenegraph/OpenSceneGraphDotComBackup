<PRE>Hi, Robert.

I agree with you that explicit usage of `this` is not something I see
frequently myself. That's a valid point. I've been on that side, too.
Probably, because I never asked myself about `this`.

My work is related to iOS development, so I've seen Apple ecosystem
migration from Objective-C to Swift. Objective-C requires `self` (aka
`this`), however, Swift does not. There have been debates about `self`
in Swift, too: <A HREF="https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide/issues/7">https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide/issues/7</A>
This migration is what made me wonder if using `this` in C++ and
`self` in Swift has benefits.

I'd like to bring a few more thoughts why `this` is better than `_`,
`m`, or `m_`:
* altering variable names to reflect environment (member / local)
always seemed inappropriate to me
* `_`, `m`, or `m_` is really just a shortcut for using `this`

So, since everybody else was already distinguishing local variables
from memeber ones with some sort of Hungarian notation, I just tried
to be honest and use facilities provided by the language itself:
`this` pointer.
In case I find a serious drawback that would cost me hours of
development time, I would definitely go back to `this`less approach.
But so far I've seen no problem with `this` approach.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * I can paste such code blocks anywhere, and a reader won't need to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the code is well written then it should be relatively clear what a
</I>&gt;<i> global functions and what a local method calls.  Most modern C++
</I>&gt;<i> programs have few global variables and functions so if you see a
</I>&gt;<i> function call it's generally safe to assume it's a local method, for
</I>&gt;<i> variables then it's most likely the variable is a local or member
</I>&gt;<i> variable.  For the OSG we just prefect with _ to make it clear it's a
</I>&gt;<i> member variable rather than global, other codebases use m_ or keep the
</I>&gt;<i> class/structs simple enough that it's clear.  Personally I don't use
</I>&gt;<i> m_ as I find it distracting and reduces the flow of readability, and
</I>&gt;<i> find this-&gt; is even more verbose and distracting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So far this approach looks better to me. When I see code referencing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; member variables/functions without `this`, I need to know what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular color IDE uses to tell member/local variables apart. And to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make things more complicated, different IDEs use different colors :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this-&gt; is a lot of typing you keep having to do just to make your code
</I>&gt;<i> intentions clear.  Developers are used to code without it and should
</I>&gt;<i> be able to work out what is local or member variable/functions pretty
</I>&gt;<i> easily if the class/structs are kept straight forward and the member
</I>&gt;<i> function kepts small enough that you can see where local variables are
</I>&gt;<i> being written.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for different IDE's doing different things.  Personally the first
</I>&gt;<i> stop should be making the code clear enough that these bells and
</I>&gt;<i> whistles aren't required, and if they are added then the developer
</I>&gt;<i> will likely be just using one IDE for majority of their work and
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't end up confused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I don't use IDE's, I just use the KDE kate editor and read
</I>&gt;<i> the class interfaces and implementations, it does highlighting of many
</I>&gt;<i> things by not discriminating between member vs local variables etc.  I
</I>&gt;<i> don't have particular issues trying to read code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When writing code for others to digest I think it is probably best to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid doing things that are unusual, and as a good practice the
</I>&gt;<i> CppCoreGuindelines are probably a good place to start as any.
</I>&gt;<i>
