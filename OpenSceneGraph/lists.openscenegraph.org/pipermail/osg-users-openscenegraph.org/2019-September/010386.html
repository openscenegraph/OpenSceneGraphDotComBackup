Thank you, Chris.
I guess that some code in osg is out-of-date and it's a bit diffcult to mantain the community. However, I believe they had done pretty good work.

I am developing 3D application using osg3.4.1 in company. It would be a  medium-sized application. The scene would be a bit complex.

Now I am struggling with shaders. Somebody told me that it is a bad choice to use glLight to implement light effect. As the links displayed, I had to pass various matrixs to shaders. As I read the source code, the matrixs had been passed using fixed pipeline api glMatrixMode and glLoadMatrix. Is there a conflict between them?
In summary, if I used the method in the link, how I deal with light and various matrix?

I would appreciate it if you share me some solutions.

Cheers
Franco
