<PRE>Got shaders to work on geometry&#8217;s now just took me getting totally frustrated and taking a walk it seems &#9786;

osgEarth::ModelLayerOptions layerOptions(&quot;test polygon&quot;, geomOptions);
osgEarth::ModelLayer* test = new osgEarth::ModelLayer(layerOptions);
osg::StateSet* tss = test-&gt;getOrCreateStateSet();
VirtualProgram* vp = VirtualProgram::getOrCreate(tss);
vp-&gt;setName(&quot;imageLayer&quot;);
myshaders shaders;
shaders.load(vp, shaders.myimagecc_Vertex);
shaders.load(vp, shaders.myimagecc_Fragment);
_map-&gt;addLayer(test);

Was the code to get it working had to apply it to the ModelLayer not the geometry and add some hooks into my shaders to keep the transparent parts the same.


Now to figure out how to get the data to change for the shaders to act on.

Ok. That helps a lot. Thanks.

So, I theorize that you are loading a 2d vector field as a data layer, that represents the 2D wind velocity vector at every data grid point covering the area, and then you use some kind of shader to display that as a colorfield and displays the moving flow lines? And then you update the 2d vector map periodically to represent the current data?

If that's the case, it sounds like you're just needing to load a conventional two-channel 2D image and do all the display work in shaders. That doesn't sound like how you're doing it though?


There's nothing at all that is file-specific about osgEarth, its drivers or its data sources. Many of the drivers talk to network-based data sources without accessing local files, so those shouldn't be an issue.

Glenn can probably comment better on how to best make a driver that updates itself periodically or on cue, but you ought to be able to just poll every 30 seconds or so and see if a data is available and refresh it somehow.
