<PRE>So I was able to get a geometry to a layer and do updates to it.  How do you add multiple geometry to a layer?

I see there is a MultiGeometry function I am able to populate it but I have no idea how to use it to get its contents displayed on a layer.

I am guess this is possible correct?

So, I don't know if Glenn Waldron of Pelican Mapping is reading this forum frequently right now. A question about &quot;best practices&quot; is probably best put to him. You might want to re-ask this on the osgEarth forum itself.

Wanted to let you know I had some success with this following code.

    // Feature Options (references the geometry)
    _featureOptions.geometry() = _polygon;

    // Model Options (references the feature options and style)
    _geomOptions.featureOptions() = _featureOptions;
    _geomOptions.merge(_featureOptions);

    osgEarth::Layer* l = _map-&gt;getLayerByName(&quot;newlayer&quot; + std::to_string(_newlayertimemin));
    osgEarth::ModelLayer* ml = dynamic_cast&lt;osgEarth::ModelLayer*&gt;(l);
    osgEarth::Features::FeatureModelSource* ms = (osgEarth::Features::FeatureModelSource*)ml-&gt;getModelSource();
    ms-&gt;getFeatureSource()-&gt;dirty();

When I was doing this before I was using ms-&gt;dirty(); which never caused the redraw but found that someone in one of the forms was using a doing it one call deeper on the ModelSource insteadof the FeatureModelSource and this fixed my update issue within my system thread.  My changes to the geometry _polygon are now working and seems to work really nicely.

Ofc if this is not the optimal way to handle this please let me know. Or if my shader idea for doing animations is not optimal please feel free to suggest ways to make it better.

Thanks.

I'd like to help you a bit more, but I've been really slammed with another osgEarth client this week. If you're patient, I can probably help you more in a few days.

shaders.load(vp, shaders.myimagecc_Fragment);
_map-&gt;addLayer(test);

Was the code to get it working had to apply it to the ModelLayer not the geometry and add some hooks into my shaders to keep the transparent parts the same.


Now to figure out how to get the data to change for the shaders to act on.

Ok. That helps a lot. Thanks.

So, I theorize that you are loading a 2d vector field as a data layer, that represents the 2D wind velocity vector at every data grid point covering the area, and then you use some kind of shader to display that as a colorfield and displays the moving flow lines? And then you update the 2d vector map periodically to represent the current data?

If that's the case, it sounds like you're just needing to load a conventional two-channel 2D image and do all the display work in shaders. That doesn't sound like how you're doing it though?


There's nothing at all that is file-specific about osgEarth, its drivers or its data sources. Many of the drivers talk to network-based data sources without accessing local files, so those shouldn't be an issue.

Glenn can probably comment better on how to best make a driver that updates itself periodically or on cue, but you ought to be able to just poll every 30 seconds or so and see if a data is available and refresh it somehow.
