If you have a compiler you can build the OSG from source.  If you
don't have a compiler then the OSG isn't for you.

Is this how you introduce yourself when you meet people in person? If
you met someone in person who called themselves by that name what
would you think of them?

Personally I think it's childish and and shows a lack of regard for
others.  If you want to any support from me going forward you use your
own human name, just like you'd use in the person.
