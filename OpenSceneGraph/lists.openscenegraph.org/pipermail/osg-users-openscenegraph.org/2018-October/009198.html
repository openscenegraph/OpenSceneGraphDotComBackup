<PRE>I currently have an odd problem I am stuck on. I have a system with 2 Quadro P5000 cards- driving 3 displays that are warped and blended on a 120 degree dome. Running Windows 10.  The application is ground vehicle simulation -  I have pretty high rates of optical flow. Each display is running its own process, they receive a UDP broadcast with position update information. What I am seeing is 1 of the displays is off by 1 frame 95% of the time. When this happens....my blending fails and I get a large seam in my scene. I added logging as to the eye point position as well as high frequency counter time. 

&gt;<i>From what I can tell from the logs, the return from the VSync's (viewer-&gt;frame() ) are all within 200 microseconds, and the eye point position and data frame number (i.e. the frame number for my incoming data) is the same across all of the channels. 
</I>
So I strongly suspect this has something to do with the graphics card/driver's own internal frame buffering....and there is not a lot I can do about it. 

This leaves me with a couple of real issues.....
1) Programmatically cannot tell if a channel is a frame behind or not. Basically I added buffering for the other 2 channels for position information......and my seam goes away 95% of the time
2) Since things are not 100% the same.......I randomly get a seam 5% of the time (assuming I am buffering).

At this point I don't know what to do.....I have talked to NVidia about this, they mentioned making sure DPI scaling in windows is set to 100% and/or setting up the app to be DPI aware. I have done this.....but I get the same result.


Any advice and/or speculative guesses on this would be great.
