</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the suggestion and links.  I had been wondering about there

</I>&gt;<i> can be even worse than normal with the two group of cores on the
</I>&gt;<i> Ryzen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have followed your suggestion of using taskset to set the affinity
</I>&gt;<i> to -c 0-7 and various other combinations but don't see any consistent
</I>&gt;<i> difference to be able to declare that it's having a positive affect -
</I>&gt;<i> the variation in frame rates between different runs is wider than any
</I>&gt;<i> differences using taskset has.  I've been trying runs of the same
</I>&gt;<i> software (osgviewer &amp; osg2vsg viewer) and with the same dataset on my
</I>&gt;<i> Intel and AMD boxes with different taskset and if anything the Intel
</I>&gt;<i> benefits more, and the results are perhaps slightly more consistent.
</I>&gt;<i> Differences are in the 1-2% range, but each run I can see as much
</I>&gt;<i> variation as this so I'd say the results are statistically
</I>&gt;<i> significant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The tests I've been doing just now use an old city model that I have,
</I>&gt;<i> it's not a large model and doesn't use any advanced features being
</I>&gt;<i> derived originally from a Creator/OpenFlight model.  Total number of
</I>&gt;<i> Geometries is 2268, number of Group nodes 1518, Transforms 552,
</I>&gt;<i> Vertices and Primtives 161,061 and 46,396 respectively and finally
</I>&gt;<i> 1105 StateSet's.  When using the same animation path file, and
</I>&gt;<i> rendering at 192x108 (1/100th pixels of my display to avoid fill
</I>&gt;<i> limit) this small city model renders at:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                               OSG      OSG(vfs)    VSG
</I>&gt;<i> core-i7-4770s     672fps    432fps       2845fps
</I>&gt;<i> AMD 2700           547fps   347fps        2320fps
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The OSG(vsg) is running osgviewer with just view frustum sides enabled
</I>&gt;<i> so that small feature culling is not enabled.  This makes quite a bit
</I>&gt;<i> of difference to the OSG performance on this model, so switching it
</I>&gt;<i> off rather hobbles the OSG for this dataset and animation path but as
</I>&gt;<i> the VSG doesn't have small feature culling or LOD it's a bit of better
</I>&gt;<i> comparison like for like with the VSG.  The OSG in these case are
</I>&gt;<i> running with DrawThreadPerContext while the VSG is running single
</I>&gt;<i> threaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The OSG with small feature culling results see a 22% slow down on the AMD 2700.
</I>&gt;<i> The OSG with small feature culling off see a 26% slow down on AMD 2700
</I>&gt;<i> The VSG sees a 22% slow down on the AMD2700
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is all despite having a Geforce 2060 in the AMD box vs a 1060 in
</I>&gt;<i> the Intel one, so it's looks strongly like a CPU related issue and a
</I>&gt;<i> pretty consistent once given we have two totally different scene
</I>&gt;<i> graphs exhibiting a similar slow down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those curious about how much multi-threaded helps the OSG.
</I>&gt;<i> Running Single threaded the results I get are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                               OSG      OSG(vfs)    VSG
</I>&gt;<i> core-i7-4770s     483fps    322fps       2845fps
</I>&gt;<i> AMD 2700           399fps   256fps        2320fps
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So DrawThreadPerContext vs SingleThread with small feature culling is
</I>&gt;<i> 39% faster on the Intel, 37% faster on the AMD.
</I>&gt;<i> While DrawThreadPerContext vs SingleThread without small feature
</I>&gt;<i> culling is 34% faster on the Intel, 35% faster on the AMD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The figures for the VSG are the same in the above tests as I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> yet tackled multi-threading.  The VSG also doesn't yet do depth
</I>&gt;<i> sorting of the transparent objects or do billboarding so it's not
</I>&gt;<i> quite a 1:1 match up for visuals, these features will slow the VSG by
</I>&gt;<i> some %, while multi-threading will get us back some.  The VSG hasn't
</I>&gt;<i> been optimized either so it's too early to make any conclusion from
</I>&gt;<i> the figures beyond comparing Intel vs AMD and that the VSG with Vulkan
</I>&gt;<i> is going to be significantly faster than the OSG/OpenGL for models
</I>&gt;<i> that have lots of separate geometries and state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another oddity is that in the osg2vsg test app I've added a test of
</I>&gt;<i> not fulling in the command buffer each frame, instead just
</I>&gt;<i> resubmitting the same command buffer each frame, when I do this I
</I>&gt;<i> remove the VSG's command dispatch traversal.  It doens't update the
</I>&gt;<i> eye point so it's a pretty crappy test in terms of something that is
</I>&gt;<i> widely useful in real applications but it can provide some insight in
</I>&gt;<i> the CPU overhead associated with the scene graph traversal and filling
</I>&gt;<i> the command buffer.  On the Intel system I see frame rate jump from
</I>&gt;<i> 2800fps to 6700fps, while on the AMD system frame rate stays around
</I>&gt;<i> 2200-2300fps point and if anything it actually averages slightly lower
</I>&gt;<i> fps.  This is a really odd result on the AMD system and suggest that
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps the driver/OS is doing something odd as I'm running exactly
</I>&gt;<i> the VSG version and data on both systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point I'd love to get some better performance parity between
</I>&gt;<i> Intel and AMD as a ~25% penalty is far larger than I was expecting.
</I>&gt;<i> Yesterday I tried out clang-7 on my AMD box and didn't spot any
</I>&gt;<i> notable differences with gcc 8.2.  Now taskset suggests that thread
</I>&gt;<i> migration between cores is not a significant issue for the these
</I>&gt;<i> particular scene graph tests under Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where to look next?  Happy to take suggestions.
</I>
I'd disable SMT next.

However note that the Haswell CPU mentioned above not only has a good
IPC even for today but runs close to 4GHz with Turbo. In other words
it is no slouch and I would expect it to be competitive with Ryzen
except for core count and maximum RAM amount and maybe to beat it for
workloads not using 6+ cores on Ryzen.

If you want to compare CPU performance between those two boxes outside
of OSG, use <A HREF="http://download.amd.com/demo/RyzenGraphic_27.blend">http://download.amd.com/demo/RyzenGraphic_27.blend</A> with
Blender, instructions available at
<A HREF="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3151464/you-can-find-out-how-your-cpu-compares-to-amds-ryzen-for-free.html">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3151464/you-can-find-out-how-your-cpu-compares-to-amds-ryzen-for-free.html</A>
Be sure to use the same Blender build and settings. You might be surprised.

&gt;<i> I'm now going to install Kubuntu 18.04 on the AMD system to see if
</I>&gt;<i> 18.10 and the later NVidia drivers are both having an negative effect.
