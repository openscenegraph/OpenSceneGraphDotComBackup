</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've now installed 18.04 on my new AMD2700+Geforce2060 system and did
</I>&gt;<i> a range of more tests and learnt a few things along the way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First up I tried out the open source graphics drivers that come with
</I>&gt;<i> 18.04 and they do a really poor job at supporting the 2060, screen
</I>&gt;<i> resolution pegged at 1024x768 and while the OSG compiled and ran just
</I>&gt;<i> fine for my small city test model I only get 39fps on it.  I couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> work out how to get the vulkan drivers working so didn't do any tests.
</I>
Just to set expectations there:
* there is no reclocking support for GPUs newer than Maxwell v2 in Nouveau
* Turing support in Nouveau requires fairly recent builds (early 2019)
* there is no acceleration, only llvmpipe.

As all GTX 9xx and newer always run at their slowest clock, your best
bet is always the NVIDIA drivers with these.

&gt;<i> Second I installed the NVidia drivers, Ubuntu/Kubuntu now requires a
</I>&gt;<i> few more steps than it used a few years back, seems like they have a
</I>&gt;<i> strong preference for the open source drivers, but as performance and
</I>&gt;<i> support for modern cards really sucks I don't feel this is a great
</I>&gt;<i> move.
</I>
On the AMD GPU side of things the opensource stack is in much better shape.

&gt;<i>  Once I installed the NVidia drivers I frame rate for the small
</I>&gt;<i> city scene and standard path jumped to 368fps at 1920x1020 so way more
</I>&gt;<i> than an order of magnitude better, also got my dual monitors work fine
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While exploring the different options in the GUI for the displays I
</I>&gt;<i> came across the toggle for switching off the compositor.  This used to
</I>&gt;<i> be alongside the desktop effects settings GUI, but now moved to the
</I>&gt;<i> display settings.  Switching off the compositor suddenly let the hand
</I>&gt;<i> brake off and my new system started pushing frame rates higher than my
</I>&gt;<i> older Intel+Gefore1060 system.  Curiously the old system had
</I>&gt;<i> compositor switched on and didn't see the same capping of framerates
</I>&gt;<i> with the VSG/Vulkan.  I don't know whether why this is happening as
</I>&gt;<i> they now both have 18.04 installed, perhaps it's hardware, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> it's the later NVidia drivers, I'll look to upgrading the NVIdia
</I>&gt;<i> drives on the old system next.   Switching off the compositor on the
</I>&gt;<i> Intel system helps the max performance as well, but only 25% rather
</I>&gt;<i> than 200% like I saw on the new system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that I've switched off the compositor on the AMD2700+Geforce 2060
</I>&gt;<i> system I'm seeing more predictable results between the two systems and
</I>&gt;<i> see patterns emerge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                             Intel Core i7 4770S   AMD Ryzen7 2700
</I>&gt;<i>                                Geforce 1060               Geforce 2060
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="../../../listinfo.cgi/osg-users-openscenegraph.html">OSG at 1920x1080</A>     484fps                      369fps  (28% slower)
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="../../../listinfo.cgi/osg-users-openscenegraph.html">VSG at 1920x1080</A>     2168fps                     2697fps (23% faster)
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="../../../listinfo.cgi/osg-users-openscenegraph.html">VSG at 192x108</A>         2712fps                     2842fps (4% faster)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So here we finally see the Geforce 2060 stretch it legs and beat the
</I>&gt;<i> 1060 thanks to it's better fill rate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The OSG's slow performance on the AMD chip though more than
</I>&gt;<i> overwhelmed the results at is significantly slower. For users that
</I>&gt;<i> rely on OSG applications and considering whether to go for an Intel vs
</I>&gt;<i> AMD or investing in a new GPU, the Intel is going to be the far more
</I>&gt;<i> critical change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The results show how different approaches I've used in the VSG for
</I>&gt;<i> reducing node size and the complexity of traversal, along with Vulkan
</I>&gt;<i> there just isn't the same AMD penalty that we see with the OSG,
</I>&gt;<i> instead we see the scaling we should expect with upgrading the
</I>&gt;<i> graphics hardware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The difference isn't just down to OpenGL vs Vulkan with the difference
</I>&gt;<i> between Intel and AMD, in developing the VSG I wrote two test
</I>&gt;<i> programs, osggroups and vsggroups, that both create a quad tree graph
</I>&gt;<i> (11 levels deep by default) and traversers it 10x and then destructs
</I>&gt;<i> it.  Here we can see like for like on pure CPU scene graph operations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                             Intel Core i7 4770S   AMD Ryzen7 2700
</I>&gt;<i> osgroups                 3.77 secs                  4.91  (30% slower)
</I>&gt;<i> vsggroups               0.55secs                   0.55secs - almost identical!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The results with osggroup CPU test mirrors the speed difference in the
</I>&gt;<i> osgviewer test with the small city model I've been using, so this
</I>&gt;<i> indicates that it's not just down to differences in OpenGL vs Vulkan
</I>&gt;<i> that we see differences in performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The vsg results being nearly identical doesn't quite tell the full
</I>&gt;<i> story. I've run more VSG related tests and find that double dispatch
</I>&gt;<i> visitor&amp;traversal vs single dispatch visitor&amp;traversal and find that
</I>&gt;<i> the Intel chip sees more penalty with double dispatch than the AMD
</I>&gt;<i> chip.  The AMD tests though show that the destruction of the scene
</I>&gt;<i> graph is higher than the Intel chip.  Things tend to balance out for
</I>&gt;<i> the vsggroups test though, it's more fluke than any important.  The
</I>&gt;<i> key take away is that when you use the CPU's more efficiently like the
</I>&gt;<i> VSG does compared to OSG the two chips both perform in a over similar
</I>&gt;<i> way w.r.t work per cycles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are these efficiencies hat I've efficiency with the VSG possible with
</I>&gt;<i> the OSG?  Unfortunately not without breaking key features.
</I>&gt;<i> osg::Node's are significantly bigger than their vsg::Node counterparts
</I>&gt;<i> as the OSG nodes hold more optional data.  The OSG traversal also
</I>&gt;<i> checks more settings - like NodeMask or presence of optional StateSet
</I>&gt;<i> that can be stored with all Nodes.  The osg::NodeVisitor has more
</I>&gt;<i> different options that control it's behavior so adds more work on the
</I>&gt;<i> traversal through the scene graph.  All these extra checks and memory
</I>&gt;<i> usage cause more cache misses, more branch predication failures and
</I>&gt;<i> less parallelism.  To illustrate the difference between OSG and VSG
</I>&gt;<i> when I run perf stat I see that the OSG osggroup run achieves a ~0.7
</I>&gt;<i> instructions per cycle while the VSG's vsggruoup run achieves ~2.2
</I>&gt;<i> instructions per cycle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To close the gap we'd need to look at getting rid of NodeMask on all
</I>&gt;<i> Nodes, changing NodeVisitor to be less flexible moving more
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility on the subclasses to do more work.  Such changes would
</I>&gt;<i> break a lot of end user applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Robert
