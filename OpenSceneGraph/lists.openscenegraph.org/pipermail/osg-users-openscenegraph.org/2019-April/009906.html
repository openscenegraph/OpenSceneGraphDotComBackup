<PRE>Greetings,

We have an older application using OSG 3.4.0 w/ Qt 5.5.1. I'd like to update to 3.6.3 and migrate to a newer version of Qt. I realize that osgQt has been removed, and maintained in a separate repository. We very keen on trying to refactor our code to use the osgQOpenGLWidget class, as we think that will alleviate some issues we've been having recently on newer computers.

I've successfully built OSG 3.6.3 using MSVC2013 setup by Cmake 3.14, and all is working fine.  However, I am stumped as to how to build osgQT? If I try to directly invoke Cmake, I get lots of errors as it doesn't seem to recognize OSG 3.6.3. Should I try to &quot;re-merge&quot; osgQt with OSG and build everything in one build? It doesn't appear that it was meant to work this way.

The error seems to point to some incompatibility between the OSG version osgQT is expecting and 3.6.3? Also, I see &quot;failed to parse version number, report as a bug&quot;, which is bothersome.

Apologizes if this is a simplistic question, my background is in embedded engineering, and some of the more modern compiler techniques, especially this complicated, leave me scratching a hole in my head! I'm sure there is a simple answer ...

Any help would be appreciated!

Thank you!

Cheers,
Gerald
