<PRE>Hi Fran&#231;ois

Thanks for the suggestion and links.  I had been wondering about there
was an issue with thread affinity and your links illustrates how this
can be even worse than normal with the two group of cores on the
Ryzen.

I have followed your suggestion of using taskset to set the affinity
to -c 0-7 and various other combinations but don't see any consistent
difference to be able to declare that it's having a positive affect -
the variation in frame rates between different runs is wider than any
differences using taskset has.  I've been trying runs of the same
software (osgviewer &amp; osg2vsg viewer) and with the same dataset on my
Intel and AMD boxes with different taskset and if anything the Intel
benefits more, and the results are perhaps slightly more consistent.
Differences are in the 1-2% range, but each run I can see as much
variation as this so I'd say the results are statistically
significant.

The tests I've been doing just now use an old city model that I have,
it's not a large model and doesn't use any advanced features being
derived originally from a Creator/OpenFlight model.  Total number of
Geometries is 2268, number of Group nodes 1518, Transforms 552,
Vertices and Primtives 161,061 and 46,396 respectively and finally
1105 StateSet's.  When using the same animation path file, and
rendering at 192x108 (1/100th pixels of my display to avoid fill
limit) this small city model renders at:

                              OSG      OSG(vfs)    VSG
core-i7-4770s     672fps    432fps       2845fps
AMD 2700           547fps   347fps        2320fps

The OSG(vsg) is running osgviewer with just view frustum sides enabled
so that small feature culling is not enabled.  This makes quite a bit
of difference to the OSG performance on this model, so switching it
off rather hobbles the OSG for this dataset and animation path but as
the VSG doesn't have small feature culling or LOD it's a bit of better
comparison like for like with the VSG.  The OSG in these case are
running with DrawThreadPerContext while the VSG is running single
threaded.

The OSG with small feature culling results see a 22% slow down on the AMD 2700.
The OSG with small feature culling off see a 26% slow down on AMD 2700
The VSG sees a 22% slow down on the AMD2700

This is all despite having a Geforce 2060 in the AMD box vs a 1060 in
the Intel one, so it's looks strongly like a CPU related issue and a
pretty consistent once given we have two totally different scene
graphs exhibiting a similar slow down.

For those curious about how much multi-threaded helps the OSG.
Running Single threaded the results I get are:

                              OSG      OSG(vfs)    VSG
core-i7-4770s     483fps    322fps       2845fps
AMD 2700           399fps   256fps        2320fps

So DrawThreadPerContext vs SingleThread with small feature culling is
39% faster on the Intel, 37% faster on the AMD.
While DrawThreadPerContext vs SingleThread without small feature
culling is 34% faster on the Intel, 35% faster on the AMD.

The figures for the VSG are the same in the above tests as I haven't
yet tackled multi-threading.  The VSG also doesn't yet do depth
sorting of the transparent objects or do billboarding so it's not
quite a 1:1 match up for visuals, these features will slow the VSG by
some %, while multi-threading will get us back some.  The VSG hasn't
been optimized either so it's too early to make any conclusion from
the figures beyond comparing Intel vs AMD and that the VSG with Vulkan
is going to be significantly faster than the OSG/OpenGL for models
that have lots of separate geometries and state.

Another oddity is that in the osg2vsg test app I've added a test of
not fulling in the command buffer each frame, instead just
resubmitting the same command buffer each frame, when I do this I
remove the VSG's command dispatch traversal.  It doens't update the
eye point so it's a pretty crappy test in terms of something that is
widely useful in real applications but it can provide some insight in
the CPU overhead associated with the scene graph traversal and filling
the command buffer.  On the Intel system I see frame rate jump from
2800fps to 6700fps, while on the AMD system frame rate stays around
2200-2300fps point and if anything it actually averages slightly lower
fps.  This is a really odd result on the AMD system and suggest that
perhaps the driver/OS is doing something odd as I'm running exactly
the VSG version and data on both systems.

At this point I'd love to get some better performance parity between
Intel and AMD as a ~25% penalty is far larger than I was expecting.
Yesterday I tried out clang-7 on my AMD box and didn't spot any
notable differences with gcc 8.2.  Now taskset suggests that thread
migration between cores is not a significant issue for the these
particular scene graph tests under Linux.

Where to look next?  Happy to take suggestions.

I'm now going to install Kubuntu 18.04 on the AMD system to see if
18.10 and the later NVidia drivers are both having an negative effect.

Cheers,
Robert.
