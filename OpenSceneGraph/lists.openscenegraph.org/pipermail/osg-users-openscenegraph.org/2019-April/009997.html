<PRE>Hi David,

In general is this a solid approach, or is just setting &quot;DataVariance&quot; to static for the switch good enough?

Having 1000's of Switch nodes can create a CPU load that ideally is
only somethng you'd want to pay for if you are actively using them as
Switches.  If the Switches just get to one state and for the rest of
the applications life remain the same then just replacing them with
the subgraph that is enabled should provide a performance gain.

Another alternative would be to use the osg::Node::setNodeMask(uint
mask) instead of a Switch.  It doesn't have exactly the same
functionality as the switch but can be close enough for many tasks and
as all nodes have a NodeMask and they are always checked during
traversal you don't pay any extra cost in using the NodeMask as a
switch.

Robert.
