<PRE>Hi Tim Whowantstoknow (Could you please change you &quot;surname&quot;, we don't
have a problem with remaining anonymous but use of deliberately
obnoxious names is not cool, it's we are community of people not
cartoon characters),

Longer term this will need to be removed, but for now this should be benign.

Elements like this may not be need now at all so we might be able to
remove them.  You could try removing it,

&gt;<i> Just a side node, CMake didn't find the gdal_i.lib on its own. Otherwise there were no further warnings.
</I>
The OpenSceneGraph/FindGDAL.cmake searches a range of standard
locations for the files but if it's not in these then it won't be able
to find it.  How have you installed GDAL?  Did you set the GDAL_DIR?

&gt;<i> I could not find the Qt settings right now. Has Qt support been dropped?
</I>
It's in the NEWS for the release, osgQt has been moved out into its
own dedicated project.

&gt;<i> CMake genertation and solution build both succeeded without a problem and on first glance, all the libraries have been build. So either I had some incorrect setups with rc2 or there was a general issue that has been fixed along the road.
</I>
I don't recall any relevant build changes in the rc's or since 3.6.0
was released.  It's very hard to debug platform problems remotely,  so
it might your colleagues who've had a successful build who might be
able to spot what specifically went.  If there is an OSG CMake error
somewhere then we can roll a fix into the OSG.

Robert.
