I haven't yet researched this one, but my hunch is that a couple of
additional checks to the VBO could might be required to prevent them
from being used when display lists are used - the OSG used do this so
but it looks there has been a regression due to the new
VertexArrayState support.

So this week I'll look at this, and if the community have any other
3.6.0 issue will look into them.  I expect there will be a few more
issues appear as 3.6.0 starts being rolled out more widely across
platforms and application/data types - all releases we see this happen
despite all the pleading to test widely as possible, just a
unfortunate fact of life with developing software.  What I will do is
wrap up any fixes made to the 3.6 branch into a 3.6.1, how soon this
might be will depend upon my own work schedule and what type of issues
we see appear.

I may also tag another 3.4.x release if the community has interest in
this, and the time to help out with testing.

Cheers,
Robert
