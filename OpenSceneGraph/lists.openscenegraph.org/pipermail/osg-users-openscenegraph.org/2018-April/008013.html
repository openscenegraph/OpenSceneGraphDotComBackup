<PRE>Robert,

Excellent tips!  And I totally agree.  It&#8217;s a steep learning curve for sure.

Will keep in touch with my development here..

Thanks,

-M

Hi Robert!

After a lot of hours staying up last night, this morning I found the solution.  It was surprisingly easy.

When I get back to work on Monday I will post the code that hopefully will help other people in the future.  It didn&#8217;t have to be as complicated as we were going from before.  Especially not with VS/PS 3.0+.  Fixed-function pipeline is all but obsolete these days.

Fixed function is still widely used, some OSG users still just use 100% fixed function and get on fine, other mix both, others go 100% shaders.  I don't know your background, skills or the real requirements of your application so at this point it's inappropriate to make assumptions about your particular needs.

For you it might be that a mix of fixed function and shaders will be the most productive approach, for instance you can mix fixed function with shaders via the built in uniforms that it provides.   So with my suggestion of looking at osg::ClipNode / osgclip example is starting place, to illustrate an example of positional state, osg::TexGenNode would be another.  Both of these are fixed function but also can be used directly in shaders when you use the compatible profile or GL2 builds.

As a general note, I'm here trying to help you.  I have almost 17 years of experience with helping new OSG users along the path of using the OSG effectively.  One the most common troubles that I see is in users getting a bit of ahead of themselves trying to solve the more complicated problems before understanding the basics of the OSG, this often leads to trying to force the OSG to work in a way that is far more complex than is actually required.  The best way to help is not to trying a resolve the complex route they have chosen for themselves but to get them to take a step back and explain the end goal that they are trying to achieve rather than solution that they have decided upon.

Once you know where they are going you can start point them in a more productive route and then help them take baby steps along this path.  Once they get on the right path they get to know the OSG API better and also how to think about solutions to problems.

Robert.
