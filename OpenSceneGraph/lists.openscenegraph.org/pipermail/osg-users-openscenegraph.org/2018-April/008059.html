<PRE>Hi Robert,

&gt;<i> I am not at my dev system right now
</I>
No problem, I just didn't want to miss the window for bug reporting.  I'm about to head out for the day so I'll put together that PR for the version tomorrow morning.


&gt;<i> Given it's just a debug feature it only using the inner text bounding box is OK with me.
</I>
Sounds good to me too then.


&gt;<i> I haven't looked at your modified code yet, as a general comment, then more focused a test case is at reproducing
</I>&gt;<i> the problem at hand the easiest it is for me to confirm the issue and then use it as a test case.
</I>
Agreed, I've been working on that today.

I think I found the missing link for my significant text issues.  The problem is much worse with arial.ttf than it is with the default times.ttf.  Instead of seeing a difference of +/- 0.02 units of width, I'm seeing a difference of 3.0 units of width.  The &quot;Long Text String&quot; text shifts left and right constantly.

I also added a status display text to the lower left that is similar to something we're doing in our HUD.  In arial you can see the text bouncing.  If you press &quot;2&quot;, it changes between Times and Arial:
- Times looks worse than Arial with a drop shadow, at the same font size
- You can see the fading effect in Arial as the text moves left and right

You can also toggle the lower-left corner's drop shadow using the &quot;1&quot; key.  The intent is to demonstrate that the shifting text is not due to the shadow as I first thought.  It also is intended to demonstrate the visibility problems I am having.  We had been using drop shadows to make the text more readable against similar colored backgrounds.  But in 3.6, it actually makes it harder to read the same text, especially at smaller font size.

You can find demonstrations of this in the attached osgtext.cpp.  Feel free to ignore the first attachment -- this includes those changes and more, with only the relevant code and not the rest of osgtext.

I hope this example helps demonstrate the problems I'm seeing.

As always, thanks for your time with this issue.

 - Dan
