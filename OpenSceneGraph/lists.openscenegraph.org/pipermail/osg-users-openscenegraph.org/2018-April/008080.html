<PRE>Looks like I had a graphics driver problem. Originally, I didn't think
that was the problem because the computer I'm working on has dual
graphics and it was crashing in Intel graphics mode and AMD graphics
mode. As it turns out, my dual graphics was broken and running Intel
graphics the whole time.

Now that's fixed and both drivers are broken, but at least they're
broken in different ways :P Sorry for the false alarm.

P.S. Buy NVidia graphics.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build of 3.6.0, and I'll try to look at it tonight. Do you think any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the bug fixes you already made would affect this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are the first to report a crash with osgText, so what you find

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What graphics hardware are you working with?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think the fixes I made to the OpenSceneGraph branch will fix
</I>&gt;<i> anything related to your crash, but you never know we might get lucky
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FYI. the new osgText::Text implementation uses shaders to it's work,
</I>&gt;<i> in theory it shouldn't do anything radical without checking the
</I>&gt;<i> available functionality, but perhaps your driver/hardware aren't
</I>&gt;<i> handled well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By the way, the new shaderized Text outlines are very pretty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was key deliverable for this work so it's good to hear that you
</I>&gt;<i> are seeing an improvement.
