<PRE>Hi Terry,

You are the first to report a crash with osgText, so what you find
with your debug version of the OSG will be invaluable.

What graphics hardware are you working with?

I don't think the fixes I made to the OpenSceneGraph branch will fix
anything related to your crash, but you never know we might get lucky
:<i>-)
</I>
FYI. the new osgText::Text implementation uses shaders to it's work,
in theory it shouldn't do anything radical without checking the
available functionality, but perhaps your driver/hardware aren't
handled well.

&gt;<i> By the way, the new shaderized Text outlines are very pretty.
</I>
That was key deliverable for this work so it's good to hear that you
are seeing an improvement.

Robert.
