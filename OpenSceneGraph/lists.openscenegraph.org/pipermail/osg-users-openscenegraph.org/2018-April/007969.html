<PRE>Hi Robert,

Looking good so far here with testing on GL Core 3.3.  Main concerns is that it's noisy on the console.  You just pushed a commit that helps with this in DisplaySettings::setShaderHint().  But I still see:

1) osgText prints errors about &quot;Error reading file shaders/text.frag: file not found&quot;, but correctly falls back to built-in shader.  Same with text.vert.  One fix for this is to use a custom version of readRefShaderFileWithFallback() in osgText/Text.cpp but obviously that's messy.

Other options include requiring end user apps to always package those files, or to always intercept the search with osgDB tricks.


2) Drawable::createVertexArrayStateImplementation() still has an OSG_NOTICE that spams the console in some of our apps.  Would recommend OSG_INFO or commenting out.


No other concerns at this point.  Thank you for the excellent software.

 - Dan

Hi All,

I have just tagged 3.6.0-rc5:

   <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph</A>


I'm pretty well ready to release now.  But is the code?  I need feedback from the community now on build and runtime performance.

All going well I'll tag 3.6.0.

Thanks in advance for all the final testing you can do.  As before let me know of success as well as failure.

Cheers,
Robert.
