<PRE>Hi Robert,

I've been testing the RC5 and I have a problem with text.  I saw PR # 523 and thought it might be the same problem.  It looks quite similar to the issue I'm seeing.  I updated to RC6 (includes PR 523) and things look a lot better, but not completely fixed.

I have finally been able to reproduce this in native OSG without any extra libraries.  Attached is a .cpp modification of the osgtext example that demonstrates the problem.  This is tested on RC6.


The text &quot;Left&quot; is on the left side, and (correctly) shifts position each frame (up and down).  This is important, because the position changes every frame.  But the bounding box on the Left text (incorrectly) keeps getting bigger and bigger.

The text &quot;Right&quot; is on the right side, and its position is set to the right side of &quot;Left&quot; text, based on Left's bounding box.  You'll see it float to the right as the frames redraw.  I would expect &quot;Right&quot; to stay in the same place horizontally, but it does not.


The problem seems to be related to:
1) Changing the position of the text to a new position
2) Having a drop shadow


Unfortunately I do not know how to fix this.  I can work on it if you want/need, but perhaps you see the problem right away?  Please let me know if the attachment osgtext.cpp doesn't come through for some reason.

 - Dan

Hi All,

I have just tagged release candidate 6:

    <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.6.0-rc6">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.6.0-rc6</A>

I'm really hoping this is now and we are good to go.  If things are
building and running OK I'll tag 3.6.0 tomorrow.   So yet another big
PLEASE test :-)

Let us know about success or failures so we know where we are at for the release.

Thankyou!
Robert.
