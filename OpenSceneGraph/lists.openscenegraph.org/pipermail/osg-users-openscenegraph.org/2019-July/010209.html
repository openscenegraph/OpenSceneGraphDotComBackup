<PRE>VTI, the Swedish national road and transport research institute, is an independent and internationally prominent research institute in the transport sector. VTI has a total of some 200 employees. VTI&#8217;s head office is in Link&#246;ping, with offices in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Borl&#228;nge and Lund.
We are now employing a research engineer to the research unit &quot;Driving Simulation and Visualization&quot; in Link&#246;ping.

About the job

VTI puts a lot of effort in developing new methods and tools for research in future transport systems on road and rail. A part of this is to use simulators for road vehicles, trains and railways, bicycles and pedestrians, as well as the visualization of traffic environments. We are now looking for you, who can strengthen us in this work, and is enthusiastic about developing virtual- and simulation methods to be applied in the research in future transport systems.

As a research engineer you will work in research projects with simulation and visualization as your main methods and tools, and to develop these to meet the research needs. Also, work with other types of equipment could be possible, such as test vehicles and proving grounds. The position as a research engineer involves:
&#8226; Software development, both programming and systemization in our different driving simulators
&#8226; Development of novel applied simulators and methods
&#8226; Keep in contact with our customers and research partners

There are many activities in Sweden targeting the future transport system. At VTI we are addressing the challenges in traffic safety, automatization, electrification, connectivity and digitalization of transports on road and rail.

Recently we have also developed simulators for bicycle and pedestrian in order to broaden the scope of road users. Our simulators are located in Link&#246;ping and Gothenburg, and are some of the most advanced driving simulators in the world. We use them in order to develop and test future vehicles and traffic environments so that they will be safe and attractive to use and operate. Our research partners, among others, are vehicle manufacturers, international research partners and public organizations. We are also developing simulators for special purposes such as for education of train drivers and evaluation of driving ability due to medical conditions.

You profile

You are a MSc in Computer Science &amp; IT or equivalent, senior or newly graduated. Your majors are software development, computer graphics, signals and/or control science. You have training and experience in object oriented programming in C++.

Seen as a merit:
&#8226; Experience from the automotive industry &#8211; e.g. CAN network, Autosar, ISO 26262
&#8226; Experience from the gaming industry &#8211; e.g. Unity3D, Unreal engine
&#8226; Development of embedded systems
&#8226; Development using the Qt framework
&#8226; Knowledge of Matlab/Simulink
&#8226; Experience of driving simulators

In your work you will meet with many customers, test participants, research partners and researchers. Therefore, you have good communication skills and is a good team player, but you can also take own initiatives.

Application

Welcome to send in your application including cv and other documentation you see as relevant.
