<PRE>With all due respect, I think OpenGL on headless Windows is a slight
distinction from what Andreas was asking for (OpenGL without a Windows
desktop login session). Most people doing headless OpenGL at least have a
Windows login session.

I was curious about the situation myself. We (myself, Nick and Per at Volvo
Sweden just a few hours from Remograph) and the guys at DLR in Munich have
all been pursuing headless OSG operation and context creation via EGL. The
goal is multifold -- on Linux it would be nice to not have to have XWindows
running. On other devices, it'd be nice to operate headless.

I don't know for sure if the EGL method would work on a Windows machine
that doesn't have a logged-in desktop session.

As far as I recall, the old WinNT OpnGL Tubes (and friends) screen savers
could operate prior to login on the login screen, by using the system
display context, but I'm not sure if that tactic is applicable here, but it
does suggest that somehow an OpenGL context could be created without a
desktop session. Have you tried executing a simple (non-OSG) EGL demo
executable in this situation? That would tell you if pursuing EGL to solve
the problem is worth doing.

I put in a query to some friends who might know the answer firsthand, but
haven't heard anything back. If you want to email me privately, I can try
to keep you in touch. Were your requirements specific to a particular GPU
platform (NVidia, AMD, etc) or does it need to be a vendor-agnostic
solution? Some vendors provide enhancements that others don't have.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to be the guy that says &quot;Go away and Google your problem&quot;, but I was curious and searched for OpenGL on headless Windows and saw a few results where people had managed to do it. Even if you don't find something compatible with your situation, you're likely to find more and better answers on a less-specific mailing list.
