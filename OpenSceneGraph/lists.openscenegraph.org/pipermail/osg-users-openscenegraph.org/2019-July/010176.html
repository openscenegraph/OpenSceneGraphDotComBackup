I don't yet get the leak part.  The Font class manages all of it's objects
via ref_ptr&lt;&gt;, they all will be deleted automatically once the Font get
deleted.

Is it simply that the Font's that are cached within the osgDB::ObjectCache
that is keeping Font's around independent of the scene graph objects that
are coming and going.

You can explicitly flush the ObjectCache.

Again, what makes you think there is a leak, are you using some debug tool
to determine this? If so, which one?

I am still at the point of not knowing whether it's a usage issue at your
end, a mis-understanding of how things work, or a bug in the OSG.  From the
info I have so far I don't have way of knowing, which is why I'm asking
specifically about the leak.

Robert.
