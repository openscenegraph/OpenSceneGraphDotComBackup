<PRE>To who it may concern,

I have already got TDM mentioned in my PATH variable in Windows.
I have been using the graphical version of cmake, 64 bits, for Windows.
If I leave configure and generate on the default native compiler, things seem to behave.

I have just pressed Configure followed by Generate, without
tinkering with any settings.

My Configure said the following:

******************************************************************************************************************************

With the Configure, it seems that if anything failed, the working alternative was found and used instead, with net success.

There were no Generate errors at all.

-So, my issue is that I need a bunch of .a or .lib files and the header files,
a bunch of .h files.  For reasons unknown to life as we know it, 
I have a directory tree with some files, but absolutely none of these,
as a search has revealed.  Do you have any clear suggestions what 
I should do with all my settings that come up in the red area, or what else,
to solve that malady?
