I am surprised you saw a boost with disable double precision.  What
specific element you do you change w.r.t double precision?

For the change to double precision making a difference it's a hint that you
have a scene that is poorly balanced.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thousands of objects per frame is not unusually for a scene graph
application and should work fine rendering at 60hz on modern hardware.  If
you are hitting CPU limits prematurely then it's another hint that the
scene graph is poorly balanced.

There are lots of different things you can do to create a more efficient
scene graph, exactly what to advice is hard to do without knowing more
specifics about the application and types of data being handling.  Batching
might be one thing to try, but only if it's established as the main
bottleneck.  From what you've written I wonder if the animation element to
your scene is what is slowing things down.   Are you using CPU based
animation?  Could you shift it onto the GPU?

Robert.
