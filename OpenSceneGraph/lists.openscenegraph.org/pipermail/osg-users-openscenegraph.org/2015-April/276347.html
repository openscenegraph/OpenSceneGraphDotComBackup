<PRE>Hi All,

I have just tagged the 3.3.7 developer release:

*O**pen**SceneGraph-3.3.7, **released on 15th April **2015*, key
deliverables in this dev release are:

   - Bug and build fixes
   - New osg::Camera attachment dirty mechanism to streamline the
   adjustment of FBO and Textures sizes
   - Added EXIF support to JPEG plugin, with automatic rotation of images
   according to the EXIF orientation setting
   - osg::Texture2DArray support for passing images in via an 3D osg::Image
   - Improvements to the 3DS plugins handling of transparent/diffuse
   textures and opacity maps.
   - Typo fixes to various doxygen and inline comments.
   - Support of OpenGL ES 3.0
   - Refactored osgManipulator::AntiSquish to address manipulator transform
   problems.
   - Fixed initial window size problem under WIn32 that was causing
   problems with mapping mouse coordinates for picking etc.
   - New osgjs and gles plugins to enable easy conversion of the OSG loaded
   models to work with osgjs (A Javascript/WebGL based OSG like scene graph.)

    * CMakeLists.txt, README.txt, src/osg/GL.in,
      src/osgPlugins/imageio/ReaderWriterImageIO.cpp,
      src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowIOS.mm: From Konstantin Matveyev,
      &quot;I've added GLES3 profile, which also enables GLES2 features
      (OSG_GLES3_AVAILABLE=true =&gt; OSG_GLES2_AVAILABLE=true).

      If OSG_OPENGL_PROFILE=&quot;GLES3&quot; =&gt;
      GraphicsWindowIOS will create gles3 context.
      If failed, GraphicsWindowIOS will create gles2 context.
      Multisampling also working.

      &quot;

2015-04-13 09:50  robert

    * CMakeModules/FindOpenEXR.cmake,
      src/osgPlugins/exr/CMakeLists.txt: From Laurens Voerman, I have
      modified the FindOpenEXR.cmake to find the debug libraries, and
      to define a variable
      (OPENEXR_LIBRARIES_VARS) with the variable names that might have
      a _DEBUG version defined.

2015-04-13 08:55  robert

    * examples/osgmanipulator/osgmanipulator.cpp: Added passing of
      command line arguments to viewer construction to allow one to
      specify extra controls for the viewer such as window size etc.

2015-04-09 18:42  robert

    * include/osgManipulator/AntiSquish,
      src/osgManipulator/AntiSquish.cpp: Refactored
      AntiSquish::computeUnSquishedMatrix() method to use the parent
      node path of the AntiSquish node
      to compute the required matrix rather than using the NodePath
      provided by the NodeVistor. This is required
      as in osg::computeLocalToWorld() usage case the NodeVisitor
      pointer is NULL, so the correct matrix isn't possible to compute.

2015-04-09 18:38  robert

    * examples/osgmanipulator/osgmanipulator.cpp: Added
      WindowSizeHandler to osgmanipulator example

      examples/osganalysis/osganalysis.cpp: From Janik Heller, clean up
      of drawable/node usage

2015-04-07 15:52  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/osgjs/JSON_Objects,
      src/osgPlugins/osgjs/json_stream: From Wojciech Lewandowski,
      Windows build fixes, &quot;These are the tweaks I had to make.
      JSON_Objects / json_stream headers attached. I am not sure how
      these will behave on VS 2010. Someone with VS 2010 should test
      it. Should be okay on VS 2008 and below + VS 2012 and above,
      though.&quot;

2015-04-01 09:37  robert

    * src/osg/Image.cpp: From Lionel Largarde, &quot;fix for the
      Image::computeNumberOfMipmapLevels method. The method did use the
      float version of the log function and the / operator.
      It works for most of the input sizes, but fails for 8192,
      32768...
      For 8192, the method returns 13 instead of 14.&quot;

      command line option and test subload callback for testing
      purposes

2015-03-31 16:23  robert

    * examples/osgdistortion/osgdistortion.cpp, include/osg/Camera,
      src/osg/Camera.cpp: Introduced osg::Camera::resize(..) method and
      associated enum thus:

      enum ResizeMask

      RESIZE_ATTACHMENTS=2,
      RESIZE_PROJECTIONMATRIX=4,
      RESIZE_DEFAULT=RESIZE_VIEWPORT|RESIZE_ATTACHMENTS
      };

      /** Resize, to the specified width and height, the viewport,
      attachments and projection matrix according to the resizeMask
      provided.
      * Note, the adjustment of the projection matrix is done if the
      RESIZE_PROJECTIONMATRIX mask to set and according to the rules
      specified in the ProjectionResizePolicy. */
      void resize(int width, int height, int
      resizeMask=RESIZE_DEFAULT);

2015-03-31 15:08  robert

    * examples/osgdistortion/osgdistortion.cpp, include/osg/Camera,
      src/osg/Camera.cpp: Introduced Camera::resizeAttachments(int

      resize code into a seperate Callback method in prep for this all
      being done by a single Camera API call.

2015-03-31 10:36  robert

    * include/osg/Camera, include/osgUtil/RenderStage,
      src/osg/Camera.cpp, src/osgUtil/RenderStage.cpp: Added
      Camera::dirtyAttachmentMap(),
      Camera::s/getAttachmentMapModified() value and usage of this in
      RenderStage as a new mechanism
      for telling the rendering backend to update itself to reflect new
      values in the attachments such as new texture or image sizes.

2015-03-23 11:36  robert

    * examples/osgtessellationshaders/osgtessellationshaders.cpp: Added
      StatsHandler to osgtessellationshaders example to test out
      rendering bug associated with stats rendering.

2015-03-20 17:58  robert

      X11 window

2015-03-20 11:48  robert

    * examples/osgviewerQt/osgviewerQt.cpp: From Jannik Heller, &quot;Fix
      for Qt4 multi-threaded crash. This patch adds the
      AA_X11InitThreads flag to the QApplication setup, meaning QT will
      call XInitThreads for us. This also bumps the required QT version
      to 4.8+, because the AA_X11InitThreads flag was introduced in
      that version. If that is not acceptable, we could add a
      QT_VERSION &gt;= 0x040800 guard, or manually call XInitThreads()
      instead. Let me know what you think.&quot;

2015-03-19 10:49  robert

    * examples/osgdistortion/osgdistortion.cpp: Added Texture wrap
      setting to CLAMP_TO_EDGE to fix rendering problem when running
      the default osgdistortion example

2015-03-17 18:10  robert

      wrapper

    * src/osgPlugins/osgjs/CMakeLists.txt: Removed unneccessary library
      link line.

2015-03-16 14:16  robert

    * src/osgUtil/MeshOptimizers.cpp: Removed the using namespace std
      and replaced with local std:: to make the code clearer

2015-03-16 12:13  robert

    * CMakeModules/FindFBX.cmake: From Laurens Voerman, &quot;attached is a
      zip with a modified version of:
      OpenSceneGraph\CMakeModules\FindFBX.cmake

      This version can find fbx sdk 2015.1 and will prefer it over
      older versions.

      Tested with Visual Studio Express 2013 on 64bit windows 7&quot;

    * src/osgPlugins/osgjs/json_stream: Added using namespace std and
      removed the std:: prefixes before the std::isfinte and std::isinf
      function calls to avoid problems with Android builds against
      older NDK's.

    * examples/osgtexture2DArray/osgtexture2DArray.cpp,
      include/osg/Texture2DArray, src/osg/Texture2DArray.cpp: Completed
      support for assigning 3D osg::Image to osg::Texture2DArray.

      Improved the osgtexture2DArray example to add --mipmap and
      --packed command line options to help with testing.
