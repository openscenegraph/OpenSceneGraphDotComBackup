<PRE>Hi Jannik,

General purpose double buffering of data is something I've considered in
the past but not attempted to implement into the core OSG as it introduces
a range of complexities in implementation and API.  There are places in the
OSG where buffering is done locally but in general these are areas where
the implementation is lightweight and there is a clear benefit.

In your case it's cool that you've found a way of implementing and got a
performance benefit.  It's a complexity that most users haven't tried to
tackle before, but I suspect this is probably partly down to not having the
same bottlenecks that you are probably seeing.

I don't know the bottlenecks in your app, but for DrawThreadPerContext to
make such big difference in performance it would suggest that your are CPU
bound.  Are you update, cull, draw dispatch or draw GPU bound?  Use the
osgViewer::StatsHandler to show the relatively load on screen.  Most scene
graphs app will have a pretty light update, a modest cull and draw
dispatch.  If any of these phases are the bottleneck then look to resolving
these might be the key to getting best performance rather than adding
double buffering.

Also, make sure that you are using a release build when performance
profiling, the results you get in debug make a huge difference and can
totally distort the relative cost of different phases.

Cheers,
Robert.

&gt;<i> Hi OSG friends,

</I>&gt;<i> A common challenge for OSG users are the implications of the viewer
</I>&gt;<i> threading model - by default the viewer.frame() will return before the draw
</I>&gt;<i> dispatch is complete, meaning users (and the OSG) can start preparing the
</I>&gt;<i> next frame before the current frame has completed. However, if you attempt
</I>&gt;<i> to change a StateSet or Drawable in the frame update, you run the risk of
</I>&gt;<i> modifying data that the OSG is still working with in a background thread,
</I>&gt;<i> resulting in crashes.
</I>&gt;<i> Often times you will see code dealing with this by setting the
</I>&gt;<i> DataVariance of the object to DYNAMIC. Unfortunately as result the draw
</I>&gt;<i> dispatch has to complete before the frame() returns, for me this dropped
</I>&gt;<i> the frame rate in half.
</I>&gt;<i> Recently I developed a more efficient solution for dealing with this and
</I>&gt;<i> would like to hear your thoughts.
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is similar to &quot;double buffering&quot; with the framebuffer - you
</I>&gt;<i> create two copies of the data on start, one copy is write only, another
</I>&gt;<i> copy is read only, and when the frame completes the roles are swapped. You
</I>&gt;<i> can implement this idea for both Drawables and StateSets:
</I>&gt;<i> - Dynamic Drawables (RigGeometry, MorphGeometry, etc): create a deep copy
</I>&gt;<i> of the Drawable, decorate both Drawables with a FrameSwitch node. A
</I>&gt;<i> FrameSwitch node is a variant of Group that only traverses even or non-even
</I>&gt;<i> children based on the current FrameStamp. Code (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw/blob/f7da9796692e14c79632cb85fa75a90b082cd863/components/nifosg/nifloader.cpp#L179">https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw/blob/f7da9796692e14c79632cb85fa75a90b082cd863/components/nifosg/nifloader.cpp#L179</A>
</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>&gt;<i> - Dynamic StateSets: Create two copies of the StateSet on start, then
</I>&gt;<i> every frame in a NodeCallback swap the roles of these StateSets, apply
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the first StateSet, then set the currently active StateSet on
</I>&gt;<i> the Node. Code (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/scrawl/openmw/blob/osg/components/sceneutil/statesetupdater.cpp#L8">https://github.com/scrawl/openmw/blob/osg/components/sceneutil/statesetupdater.cpp#L8</A>
</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are some downsides to this approach (mostly that for data that is
</I>&gt;<i> just rarely changing, you have to apply every change twice), but other than
</I>&gt;<i> that it works beautifully and now I've got 2x the framerate again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm curious how the OSG veterans are dealing with this. Anything I've
