<PRE>Hi,

I've built 75 of the 78 cookbooks/integrations: 3 failed for reasons that I'll investigate later.

I'd like to jump right in to running the samples in the debugger. I'm not a cmake expert, and I'm hoping there is a simple way in cmake or in the osgRecipe solution that it created to point the full set of cookbooks and integrations to the runtime libraries.

The OSG runtime libraries are installed in C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSceneGraph\lib, and the includes are installed in C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSceneGraph\include.

I specified the following two cmake tags to point to these locations:

OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIB_DIR 
OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIR

This resulted in a largely successful build (except for the 3 menioned above). I would have thought it would also suffice in order to then select a project and &quot;debug the instance&quot;. However when I try to do this, the debugger fails to find key DLL's (example osg100-osgd.dll). 

I know that I can begin to edit each project in visual studio in order to point the project to the runtime libraries. However I'd like to do this &quot;solution wide&quot; and preferably through cmake. Do you know offhand if there is a cmake option that will do this? 


Cheers,
Dave
