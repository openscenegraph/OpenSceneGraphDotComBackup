Although very interesting, this discussion regarding minimum latency is a bit of a tangent from my initial questions. Rendering with VSync Off is not normally what you do in a production environment. The interesting case is when you render with VSync enabled. Then I can live with 1-2 frames of (consistent) latency, given that the scene complexity is within what is possible to render within one frame.  But with my starting point (OSG 3.2.1 running with DrawThreadPerContext and NVIDIA default settings) was latencies of 5-6 frames, which is way to much. Especially when you consider that all I rendered was ONE quad. I have a hard time to accept that driver issues causes latencies of these magnitudes. 

Regarding rendering at higher frame rates. I will try to repeat my measurements on a couple of 120 Hz monitors next week. These monitors also support Nvidia G-sync, so I will try that as well. And of course I will measure both the Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2 (the last one both in extended and direct mode).
