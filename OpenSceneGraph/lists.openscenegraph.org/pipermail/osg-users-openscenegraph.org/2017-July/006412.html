<PRE>Hi all,

I have a general question. I've googled this before, but I haven't had any luck. I am new to programming world, so I decided to give it a shot on this forum/mailing list.
I have a program written in C++ and it uses OSG and OpenGL for its visual graphics. I have a simple GUI code in Python that says &quot;Hello my friend&quot; on the left side and I'd like to have my OSG program on the right side.
Is this possible? The thing I am confused about is whether Python is capable of displaying my C++/OSG program or not. Basically, imagine my main program has some buttons, texts, menus, and a graphic OSG part inside it-let's say as a small window. The best outcome would only display that OSG window. I am not interested in displaying the entire program in my python GUI window. Would that be possible? I don't care if I have to run the program alongside my python program or if I can embed my main program or at least part of it in my python. Again, I've never done programming before, so sorry for my bad description.


Best,
Arman
