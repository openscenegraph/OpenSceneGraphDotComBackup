<PRE>Hi All,

I have just tagged the first 3.4.1 release candidate :


<A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.4.1-rc1">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.4.1-rc1</A>

Lots of bug and build fixes since 3.4.0.  Please test across as many OS and
build plaforms as you can, and against your own applications.

Thanks in advance for you help with testing,
Robert.

-- ChangeLog since 3.4.0:

Fri, 28 Jul 2017 17:43:34 +0100
Checked in by : Robert Osfield
Updated 3.4 branch to 3.4.1-rc1 version

Fri, 5 Aug 2016 13:16:07 +0100
Checked in by : James Turner
Attempt to fix broken DLL exports from osgDBOnly export the osgDB method
implementations, instead of the entire
class, and hence avoid exporting symbols from the base class, which
then conflict with other compilation units when linking.

This avoids the need for /FORCE:MULTIPLE linker option with MSVC.

to diff between them.

Tue, 25 Jul 2017 15:58:27 +0100
Checked in by : Robert Osfield
Merged GLExtension deletion mechanism from master to avoid GLEXtension
being deleted when shared contexts are used and osg::State is deleted when
a context is deleted.

&gt;<i>From Bjorn Blissing, &quot;I stumbled upon a strange ifdef-case inside
</I>Geometry.cppCurrently the code looks like this:

Code:
    DrawElementsUByte* elems = new
DrawElementsUByte(PrimitiveSet::TRIANGLES);
    elems-&gt;push_back(0);
    elems-&gt;push_back(1);
    elems-&gt;push_back(2);

    elems-&gt;push_back(2);
    elems-&gt;push_back(3);
    elems-&gt;push_back(0);
    geom-&gt;addPrimitiveSet(elems);
    geom-&gt;addPrimitiveSet(new DrawArrays(PrimitiveSet::QUADS,0,4));

The second condition looked really strange (note the ! sign), and results
in pretty much all code paths uses the first code. The correct version
should probably be that only people with GLES1 or GLES2 should use
GL_TRIANGLES to simulate quads. And all others should use the native
support for GL_QUADS.

Introduced CMake option OSG_PROVIDE_READFILE option that defaults to ON,
but when switched to OFF disables the building of the osgDB::read*File()
methods, forcing users to use osgDB::readRef*File() methods.  The later is
preferable as it closes a potential threading bug when using paging
databases in conjunction with the osgDB::Registry Object Cache.  This
threading bug occurs when one thread gets an object from the Cache via an
osgDB::read*File() call where only a pointer to the object is passed back,
so taking a reference to the object is delayed till it gets reassigned to a
ref_ptr&lt;&gt;, but at the same time another thread calls a flush of the Object
Cache deleting this object as it's referenceCount is now zero.  Using
osgDB::readREf*File() makes sure the a ref_ptr&lt;&gt; is passed back and the
referenceCount never goes to zero.To ensure the OSG builds when
OSG_PROVIDE_READFILE is to OFF the many cases of osgDB::read*File() usage
had to be replaced with a ref_ptr&lt;&gt; osgDB::readRef*File()
usage.  The avoid this change causing lots of other client code to be
rewritten to handle the use of ref_ptr&lt;&gt; in place of C pointer I introduced
a serious of
templte methods in various class to adapt ref_ptr&lt;&gt; to the underly C
pointer to be passed to old OSG API's, example of this is found in
include/osg/Group:

    bool addChild(Node* child); // old method which can only be used with a
Node*

    tempalte&lt;class T&gt; bool addChild(const osg::ref_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; child) { return
addChild(child.get()); } // adapter template method

These changes together cover 149 modified files, so it's a large
submission. This extent of changes are warrent to make use of the Object
Cache
and multi-threaded loaded more robust.

&gt;<i>From Jannik Heller, &quot;I've hit what I believe to be a bug (or at the very
</I>least, an unintuitive behaviour) in the osg::Geometry copy constructor. I
noticed it when using osg::clone on a Geometry with vertex buffer objects,
and the copy flags DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS. To be precise, I add a Geometry to an
osgUtil::IncrementalCompileOperation, then osg::clone the Geometry. I was
getting reports from users of random crashes happening.I believe the
offending lines are in the osg::Geometry copy constructor:

    if ((copyop.getCopyFlags() &amp; osg::CopyOp::DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS))
    {
        if (_useVertexBufferObjects)
        {
            // copying of arrays doesn't set up buffer objects so we'll
need to force
            // Geometry to assign these, we'll do this by switching off
VBO's then renabling them.
            setUseVertexBufferObjects(false);
            setUseVertexBufferObjects(true);
        }
    }

Toggling the vertex buffer objects off then on again actually touches not
only the arrays controlled by DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS, but also the PrimitiveSets
which are controlled by DEEP_COPY_PRIMITIVES. This means if the user has
copyflags of only DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS, we are modifying arrays that belong to
the original const Geometry&amp; we are copying from. I believe this shouldn't
be allowed to happen because we are using a const&amp; specifier for the
original Geometry.

In my case the osgUtil::IncrementalCompileOperation was trying to compile
the geometry, while in the main thread a clone operation toggled the VBO's
off and on, a crash ensues.

In the attached patch, you will find a more efficient handling of VBO's in
the osg::Geometry copy constructor, so that only the Arrays that were
actually deep copied have their VBO assigned, and no changes are made to
Arrays that already had a valid VBO assigned. In addition, the
DEEP_COPY_PRIMITIVES flag is now honored so that VBO's are set up correctly
should a user copy a Geometry with only that flag.

</I>PAGE_AND_DISCARD_USED_IMAGES triggers the (3) imageThreads to run and never

stop condition currently setting the thread to stop and wait for a signal
only when no work needs to be done AND the databasepager is paused. It
should stop and wait for a signal on either of those two. Due to a few
logical inversions it boils down to replacing || with &amp;&amp;OLD
_block-&gt;set((!_requestList.empty() || !_pager-&gt;_databasePagerThreadPaused));
NEW _block-&gt;set((!_requestList.empty() &amp;&amp;
