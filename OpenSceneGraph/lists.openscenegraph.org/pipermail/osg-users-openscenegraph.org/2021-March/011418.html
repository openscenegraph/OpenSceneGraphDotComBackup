<PRE>Hey everyone. After like 6 years of it sitting there and being stale, we
finally revamped the AlphaPixel website to reflect all the things we now do
(we now have several business units that do things other than 3D software
development).

So, there's a new AlphaPixel Development website at
<A HREF="https://alphapixeldev.com/">https://alphapixeldev.com/</A>

and the old AlphaPixel.com URL is sort of a directory of our different
business units/divisions/whatevers.

So, if you haven't been by recently, stop by and see what we're about and
what we do.


Also, we've been working with and funding Robert to properly
implement/integrate an OpenGL extension we developed OSG support for last
year for one of our OSG/osgEarth clients. We're gonna announce that in
conjunction with Robert maybe next week. I suspect a significant number of
the users on this list may find it very useful.

Following that in a little while, we hope to have another exciting
announcement of an OSG demo application that uses the extension to do cool
things.

And we have more cool news queued up following that.

If you're into the social media thing, follow our Twitter or Facebook or
LinkedIn pages to stay informed. 2021 is going to be a busy and exciting
year and we look forward to experiencing it with you all.
