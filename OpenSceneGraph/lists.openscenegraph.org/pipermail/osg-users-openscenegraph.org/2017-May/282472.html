<PRE>Hi All,

I have just tagged the 3.5.6 developer release, another step along the
road to the next stable release :-)

<A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.5.6">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.5.6</A>

Lots of work has gone in between 3.5.6, so much so I'm lost to think
of the stand out changes. It's end of busy week so my brain is bit
frazzled and happy not to think to deeply about stuff!  Full change
log below.

Thanks to all those who have contributed fixes, features additions and
testing in this dev release cycle.

Cheers,
Robert.

ps... Ummm major stuff...  osgText rewritten to support VAO +
GLES2/GL3 shaders. StatsHandler supports GLES2/GL3 shaders.
PolytopeIntersector/KdTree rewritten to support all primitive types
and to work together, wow that's jsut a tiny tiny bit of what's gone
on in the last six months...  Perhaps I should do a proper review...
but then again it's nearly the weekend and time to chill!!! :-)

Avoid call of SetupThreads in DatabasePagerThis solves a bug with some
shared library configurations. Sometimes the DatabasePager Singleton
is initialised before one can call other configuration options like
&quot;setNumOfDatabaseThreadsHint&quot;. But OSG initialise it here:

<A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/blob/master/src/osgDB/DatabasePager.cpp#L1555">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/blob/master/src/osgDB/DatabasePager.cpp#L1555</A>

So this call is not needed?!

There is a small bug in how the FBX importer computes the rotation
matrix for nodes. It applies the &quot;RotationOrder&quot; property to the
local, pre, and post rotation values. However, the pre/post rotation
values should always use a fixed XYZ order. The &quot;RotationOrder&quot;
property should only apply to the local rotation value. I've attached
the updated file with the fix.

Tue, 18 Apr 2017 16:40:56 +0100
Author : Farshid Lashkari
Modified the FBX loader to support bump, specular, and gloss maps.
I've attached a zip containing the modified files.

When the &quot;ZUp&quot; option was added to the fbx loader, it broke the
previous behavior of converting to the OpenGL axis system. I'm
referencing the following
commit:<A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/commit/c168887e5e9da4e891904d11ccac8ddd60b0362d">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/commit/c168887e5e9da4e891904d11ccac8ddd60b0362d</A>

This commit inverted the value of the &quot;fSign&quot; variable, but did not
update the previous code that used the variable. I've attached the
change that restores the original behavior when not using the &quot;ZUp&quot;
