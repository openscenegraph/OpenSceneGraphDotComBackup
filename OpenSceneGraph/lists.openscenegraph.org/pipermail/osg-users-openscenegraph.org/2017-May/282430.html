<PRE>Hi All,

Today I merged two branches into master that contain some significant
changes to KdTree, LineSegment and PolytopIntersector and
AutoTransform respectively.  I would like testing of these as well all
the rest of the changes from the community that I've merged this week.
If things look stable then I'll tag 3.5.6 developer release.

On the KdTree/Intersector front I've refactor KdTree to support point,
line and quad primitives in addition to original triangles that is
supported.  The LineSegmentIntersector c;ass has been updated use the
new KdTree API and unifies it's intersection code which will make it
easier to maintain going forward.  The PolytopeIntersector adds
support for using KdTree's to accelerate intersection testing so you
can now get KdTree accelerated intersections for point clouds and line
models.

The AutoTransform class has been re-factored so that it now computes
transforms on the fly within the cull traversal, this change enables
support for use in applications that use multiple Views and share the
same subgraphs that contain AutoTransform.  For most users you won't
need to make any changes, it'll just work as before, only now it'll
properly work in when you use multiple views.  If you application is
hardwired to the internal data structures in AutoTransform you may
need to refactor the code as some of the internal structures no longer
exist.

Thanks in advance for testing,
Robert.
