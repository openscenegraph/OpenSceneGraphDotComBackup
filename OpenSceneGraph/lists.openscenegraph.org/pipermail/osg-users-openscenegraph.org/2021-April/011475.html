<PRE>What about those who can't use the google mailing list?

</I>&gt;<i> is the last day as it's become an attack vector for bots to an extent that

</I>&gt;<i> This has become necessary as this year the osg-users and osg-submissions
</I>&gt;<i> lists have been under increasing target for nefarious bots that have been
</I>&gt;<i> attempting to subscribe a broad range of email addresses.   It's now become
</I>&gt;<i> a deluge - I'm getting notifications of new attempts as I type this
</I>&gt;<i> message, and unfortunately there isn't any means I can find for mailman to
</I>&gt;<i> thwart this type of broad attack, so it's requiring an ever increasing
</I>&gt;<i> amount of manual work from me to clear the backlog of requests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's also no way for me to know whether an address is a genuine
</I>&gt;<i> subscription so unfortunately there may be rejection that has happened
</I>&gt;<i> because the subscriptions are swamped by dozens of fake ones, many which
</I>&gt;<i> are plausible addresses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a C++/OpenGL/Vulkan programmer playing wack a mole with bots trying to
</I>&gt;<i> abuse the community just isn't a good use of my time nor helpful for the
</I>&gt;<i> osg-users community.  The osg-users google group doesn't look to be
</I>&gt;<i> affected by this attack vector so it'll be a far better place for us to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss OSG topics without the overhead of admin that the old mailman lists
</I>&gt;<i> now involve.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have already deleted the osg-submissions list as it's no longer active -
</I>&gt;<i> github.com PR's have taken over for quite a while now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will leave the osg-uses mailing list up for the test of today.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> delete it later today or tomorrow morning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your patience,
</I>&gt;<i> Robert.
