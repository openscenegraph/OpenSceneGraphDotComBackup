<PRE>Hi All,

I have managed the osg-users mailing list for two decades with little
issues along the way, it mostly has just looked after itself.  Alas today
is the last day as it's become an attack vector for bots to an extent that
it's swamping my support work.  I'll be deleting the list later today, for
those that wish to continue with support please subscribe to the osg-users
google group:

    <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/g/osg-users">https://groups.google.com/g/osg-users</A>

This has become necessary as this year the osg-users and osg-submissions
lists have been under increasing target for nefarious bots that have been
attempting to subscribe a broad range of email addresses.   It's now become
a deluge - I'm getting notifications of new attempts as I type this
message, and unfortunately there isn't any means I can find for mailman to
thwart this type of broad attack, so it's requiring an ever increasing
amount of manual work from me to clear the backlog of requests.

There's also no way for me to know whether an address is a genuine
subscription so unfortunately there may be rejection that has happened
because the subscriptions are swamped by dozens of fake ones, many which
are plausible addresses.

I'm a C++/OpenGL/Vulkan programmer playing wack a mole with bots trying to
abuse the community just isn't a good use of my time nor helpful for the
osg-users community.  The osg-users google group doesn't look to be
affected by this attack vector so it'll be a far better place for us to
discuss OSG topics without the overhead of admin that the old mailman lists
now involve.

I have already deleted the osg-submissions list as it's no longer active -
github.com PR's have taken over for quite a while now.

I will leave the osg-uses mailing list up for the test of today.  Then
delete it later today or tomorrow morning.

Thanks for your patience,
Robert.
