<PRE>Hi Anton,

</I>
I haven't yet reviewed the CullVisitor.cpp code but looking at the
code above it looks like there is code hasn't been updated to reflect
the refactor of osg::Drawable so that is subclasses from osg::Node.
Now that Drawable subclasses from Node it inherits the
Node::s.getCullingActive() flag is should check it's own flag now
rather than it's parent as it would have done before.

The code above looks like it's write to check that Drawable parent to
whether it should check for culling or not, but probably isn't doing
that now as the NodePath managed by the NodeVisitor will include the
node being visited so the back will actually be the Drawable rather
than the Geode parent.

Whether the CullVisitor should enforce the old behaviour is not is an
open question - doing so would make the behaviour inconsistent to how
all other Nodes are handled i.e. the Node's own CullingActive flag
affects it and it's parents, but not it's children.  The old
Geode/Drawable CullingActive behaviour instead affected all parents
and children of the Geode.

FYI, 3.4.x will also behave like 3.5.1 as the Drawable changes were
made prior to 3.4.0.

Robert.
