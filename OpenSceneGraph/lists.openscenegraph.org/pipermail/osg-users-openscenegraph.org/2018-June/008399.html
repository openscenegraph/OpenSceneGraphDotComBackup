No we aren't, I didn't start this thread to debate with the community
the pros and cons of every decisions.  I made the original an
announcement that project is under-way and that the initial phase will
be mostly done privately.

If there are questions people have and I can provide some clarity at
this stage then I'm happy to do so.  However, VulkanSceneGraph isn't a
design by committee.  I'm not looking to debate stuff.

Once the project comes out of the Exploration Phase and into the
Implementation Phase I'll have a clearer direction, will publish a
design document and likely have some code to share.

The community will need to trust me on this stuff during this less
public phase of project work.  I'm an experienced open source project
lead, I have witnessed all the trials and tribulations that the
OpenSceneGraph users have in developing graphics application for
nearly two decades.  All this experience informs my decisions.  My
goal is to VulkanSceneGraph a thing of beauty and practicality.

Cheers,
Robert.
