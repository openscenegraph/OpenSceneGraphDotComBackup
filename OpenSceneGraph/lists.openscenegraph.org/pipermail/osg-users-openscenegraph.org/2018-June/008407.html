<PRE>I was mostly suggesting POCO in terms of all of the support code that it
provides for the parts outside the core scenegraph. But I understand that
that's not what you're focusing on right now.

&gt;<i> Hi Chris,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to throw out the concept of using something like Conan.io (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://conan.io/">https://conan.io/</A> ) to assist with 3rdparty package management.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the current phase of work I don't plan to look at package
</I>&gt;<i> management, my current focus is on Vulkan, C++ and scene graph design.
</I>&gt;<i> Once we actually have a prototype scene graph to play with we can
</I>&gt;<i> start to think about ancillary issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the initial work my aim is to only have C++11 and Vulkan as
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to do whatever is feasible to make this new scene graph
</I>&gt;<i> more easily approachable by new developers, as I think it speeds adoption
</I>&gt;<i> and spread. I applaud the idea of using things like language-core thread
</I>&gt;<i> features and possibly existing platform libraries like BOOST or POCO to
</I>&gt;<i> supply technologies that are already-invented. I think this will greatly
</I>&gt;<i> simplify the codebase and reduce the potential for novel error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't seen any compelling reason to make Boost a dependency.
</I>&gt;<i> With C++11 there even less reason to think about Boost as all the most
</I>&gt;<i> valuable parts are parts are in C++.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not familiar with with POCO, but a quick search online makes me
</I>&gt;<i> wonder why you suggested it.  It doesn't seem related to the core
</I>&gt;<i> issues scene graph design/implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For something to be made of dependencies of the core VulkanSceneGraph
</I>&gt;<i> it will offer very significantly level of value to the core scene
</I>&gt;<i> graph.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, Paul Martz, when he wrote a non-FFP scenegraph (called JAG
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/pmartz/jag-3d/">https://github.com/pmartz/jag-3d/</A> ) a number of years ago, utilized
</I>&gt;<i> BOOST, POCO and a math library named GMTL (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ggt.sourceforge.net/html/main.html">http://ggt.sourceforge.net/html/main.html</A> ). JAG also had linkage to OSG,
</I>&gt;<i> allowing it to use OSG to load a file, then a visitor to traverse the
</I>&gt;<i> loaded graph and rewrite it into a JAG graph. OSG's support for Performer
</I>&gt;<i> in the early days allowed this same sort of bootstrapping trick, I believe,
</I>&gt;<i> until OSG had its own diversity of native loaders.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jeremy Moles' Heirograph scenegraph (GL3+, GLES2+ and prototype Vulkan
</I>&gt;<i> support) used GLM ( <A HREF="https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html">https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html</A> ) instead,
</I>&gt;<i> because the syntax of the math library is exactly the same as GLSL's. Not
</I>&gt;<i> sure if that's good or bad, but both those libraries are pretty bulletproof.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did look at GMTL a long while back, and recently looked at GLM.
</I>&gt;<i> While I can see some value in GLM for some users it's a huge set of
</I>&gt;<i> code for what it is, or at least what we'd need from it for doing a
</I>&gt;<i> scene graph.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly want to keep the scene graph small, coherent and focused,
</I>&gt;<i> not splurge all over the place with monster dependencies, each with
</I>&gt;<i> their own set of style/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you think looking at the Heirograph design would be helpful, I might
</I>&gt;<i> be able to make that happen. The concept there was to have a modular API
</I>&gt;<i> backend to potentially support GL3/4, GLES2/3 and Vulkan all on the same
</I>&gt;<i> library platform. I don't know if that's relevant anymore, but I think the
</I>&gt;<i> idea of decoupling the graph architecture from the graphics API backend
</I>&gt;<i> driver is compelling in that it would help adapt to any future API
</I>&gt;<i> evolutions as well, and could leave the door open to things like Apple's
</I>&gt;<i> Metal, DirectX (Microsoft's Hololens / UWP currently only supports the DX
</I>&gt;<i> platform for 3D), etc. And I think it's good abstractional architecture
</I>&gt;<i> decoupling too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Previously I've considered design and implementation issues of
</I>&gt;<i> supporting multiple API's in a scene graph and feel that it comprises
</I>&gt;<i> the design and complicates the implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vulkan is very different from OpenGL, it needs a different way of
</I>&gt;<i> managing things, it deserves a dedicated scene graph to make the most
</I>&gt;<i> of its capabilities without compromise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Robert.
