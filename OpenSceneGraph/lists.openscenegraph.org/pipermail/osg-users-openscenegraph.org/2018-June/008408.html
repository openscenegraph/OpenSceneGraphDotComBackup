<PRE>Hi Chris,

</I>
One thing I feel is worth doing is keeping the core VulkanSceneGraph
project more focused on just the scene graph and rendering it, rather
than adding many ancillary features like the OpenSceneGraph has.

These additional features are still essential to many users so I
envisage more 3rd party NodeKits that build upon the core
VulkanSceneGraph that users can use, some of these might be siblings
to the VulkanScenGraph project like osgQt is now to OpenSceneGraph
sitting alonside it in the openscenegraph github account, or
completely independent like osgEarth.

I also think that many users don't want to just compose their
applications from VulkanSceneGraph and various addon NodeKits I expect
many will want higher level functionality tailored to specific
application sectors.  So for instance a  VulkanImageGenerator
framework that pulls all the bits required for the simulator market,
another for first person games, etc. etc.

It might be that some developers want to take on the likes of
Unity/Unreal and need a scene graph to build this upon, the
VulkanSceneGraph and addons could all be nestled within doing the
heavy lifting.

Somewhere in all of this might a project the uses POCO, but as I never
used it myself I won't attempt to say what type of NodeKit or
framework that it would be best be deployed - this is something I'm
more than happy to let the community go wild with.  For me, having
made the decision that VulkanSeneGraph won't attempt to encompass a
massive range of functionality but keep focussed, I have the
luxury/opportunity of donning a set of blinkers for all ancillary
topics to the core issue of Vulkan, C++ and scene graphs.  If I get
mixing of these core technologies right then it'll be a fertile ground
for the community to build great frameworks and applications.

Cheers,
Robert.
