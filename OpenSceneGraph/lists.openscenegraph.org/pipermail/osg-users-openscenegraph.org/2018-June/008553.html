<PRE>Hi all. Just wanted to update everyone on something we've been working very
hard on. Over the last year we've done a ton of work on OSG and osgEarth
the mobile platforms -- iOS and Android.

There was way more work to do than we had expected, as osgEarth doesn't
really officially track the GLES targets so there were many regressions
recently. Additionally, osgEarth has moved to a mostly-GL3 target, which
means we need GLES3 features and lots more work to support it properly on
mobile devices.

We have most osgEarth capabilities working properly on modern iOS and
Android devices, but there's still lots of work to be done to make the
process of building for these targets easier and more practical for average
users (we've spent hundreds of man hours to get to where we are and even
still not everything works).

If you or your organization are interested in better OSG and osgEarth
support on mobile devices, maybe you can get in touch with us and discuss
arrangements where we can get some funding to sort out issues that might be
things you need solved.
