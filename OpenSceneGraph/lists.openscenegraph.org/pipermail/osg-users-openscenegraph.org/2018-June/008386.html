<PRE>I've been using Macs and developing on MacOS for over 25 years now, but
still I gotta say I completely understand your frustration Robert. My past
two computers have been Windows laptops, which is also the first time I've
bought non-Mac hardware, mainly because Apple doesn't seem to care about VR
(which has been important to me recently).

Nevertheless, supporting MacOS alongside Windows &amp; Linux is a necessity in
my field (aerospace). It looks like Vulkan will be available on OSX, even
if it's without Apple's official support. Once VulkanSceneGraph gets going,
I'll do my bit to help with Mac support.
