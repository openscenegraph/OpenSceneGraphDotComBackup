Even though I'm close to 60, rather than 6, and have been a software developer for 40 years, I can still learn a few new things, like that just because I expect and don't care that people use dumb pseudonyms on the Internet, other people are not severely affected.  My bad, and you and my fellow forum users have my sincerest apology.

No problem, thanks for taking steps to improve your name.  The issue
with non human names is a nightmare for a project lead like myself.
You have dozens of different conversations each day, hundreds through
the month on various different venues - some on github, some on email
direct, some via the forum/osg-uses ML, if everyone uses the same
proper human name across all these platforms you can use normal human
tracking of who's who and what you've said to whom, when the numbers
of contacts goes up then it gets harder to keep track but it's more
doable.

Once people start introducing non human names, and use one name one
place, another somewhere else it becomes far far harder to know who's
said what and when, it rapidly becomes a nightmare.  Something that
should be straight forward then requires any extra level of conscious
unpicking of the indirections that these psuedonames introduce.  What
might seem a &quot;convenience&quot; for end users to pick any name they wish
for any whimsical reason becomes are serious burden, and as the years
go by the problem has gotten worse.  It's just horrible to have to
wade through this stuff.

It's just so much more efficient to use proper human names right
across all mediums of communication, no indirections, leverage
existing brain pathways for remembering who's who.  Humans came up
with these names to help communication, it's one of the clever bits of
societal glue then enables civilizations to be cohesive and grow.  One
you loose face to face contact it becomes even more important not less
as you need all the cues you can get.

Cheers,
Robert.
