<PRE>Hi Robert,

thanks for the quick reply.
What I actually need is a very high resolution screenshot from a
standard scene with
some objects displayed like bacxkground, HUD etc.
You are right in viewing at it like a powerwall with those objects being
spread over all screens.

I can easily get the correct result by temporary multiplying the
projection matices of the main
and all ABSOLUTE cameras with an offset matrix (like slave camera).
Doing a .frame(), reading the screenshot
and then doing the next tile.
As a result the screen flickers during this procedure.
My idea was using a slave camera bound to a pixelbuffer, applying an
offset matrix to that camera and at the
same time setting this offset matrix to a uniform with OVERRIDE. All
vertex shaders of ABSOLUTE cameras can
use this uniform to translate vertex positions.
So only the render pass of the slave camera will have those offsets.
Or do you know any better method for, let's say, rendering a screen quad
over many tiles?
I think my problem is the wrong usage of the offset matrix in the vertex
shader.
