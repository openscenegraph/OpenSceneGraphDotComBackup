You could argue that this makes a shared_ptr twice the size of an
osg::ref_ptr, but I really can't speculate on the overall effect on memory
usage.

&gt;<i> So... as my aim where possible is to make the VulkanSceneGraph more
</I>&gt;<i> efficient than the OpenSceneGraph I can't just put chains around my ankles
</I>&gt;<i> by adopting shared_ptr&lt;&gt;, instead I will acknowledge where the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSceneGraph already does something well and following this approach,
</I>&gt;<i> albeit in a modern C++ way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the thread safe observer_ptr&lt;&gt; you do need a separate auxiliary
</I>&gt;<i> object, just like the OSG, so in my prototyping this is already what I have
</I>&gt;<i> done.  I already have an vsg::Auxiliary object that is created when
</I>&gt;<i> required, this Auxiliary object is for more than just supporting
</I>&gt;<i> observer_ptr&lt;&gt; though, it also stores optional extra user data.  Doing this
</I>&gt;<i> shrinks the base vsg::Object/Node classes and improves memory utilization,
</I>&gt;<i> providing a measurable gain in construction, destruction and traversal of
</I>&gt;<i> the scene graph over what can be done with the OSG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>What's the measured gain?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When adopting new features of C++ you have to understand what is happening
</I>&gt;<i> under the hood, for software that is performance critical like a scene
</I>&gt;<i> graph you have to take the time to make sure
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Agreed :)

&gt;<i> there aren't hidden performance costs are, if there is a cost then you
</I>&gt;<i> have to be really sure that this cost is worth the value it provides.
</I>&gt;<i> shared_ptr&lt;&gt;/weak_ptr&lt;&gt; don't cut it for the core scene graph.  There are
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of other modern C++ features that are really neat and just make life
</I>&gt;<i> easier without a cost, you'll see this sprinkled everywhere in the
</I>&gt;<i> VulkanSceneGraph.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course I trust your judgement, but I struggled mightily with weak
</I>pointer thread safety back in the day and am happy to be able to make it
someone else's problem now. I am very happy that VulkanSceneGraph is coming
on the scene!
