<PRE>Hi All,

Since the 3.6.1 stable release went out there have a several bugs picked up
and fixed, so I've begun the process of getting a 3.6.2 maintenance release
out to wrap these improvements up. There is always a chance that these
fixes have introduced regressions, or simply that there are still bugs left
to uncover so further community testing of required.  As it hasn't been
long since 3.6.1 I'm optimistic that it won't take much to get 3.6.2 ready
to go out, I'm hoping to tag the 3.6.2 before the end of next week as I'll
be heading off for 10 days holiday right after :-)

First step towards 3.6.2 is our first release candidate:


<A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.6.2-rc1">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.6.2-rc1</A>

Please test across as many build combinations and end user applications as
you can.  Could you report success or failures here on this thread so we
have an idea of how well things are converging towards the final 3.6.2.

Thanks for you help testing,
Robert.

As the author of all the files in osgPresentation and present3D have
rectified the license notices to reflect their intended license rather than
histoical license they had prior to being merged into the OpenSceneGraph
project.  OSGPL was always intended but missed during merge. Replaced the
GPL notices with OSGPL usge in present3D and include/osgPresentation as
this was intended when Present3D was merged back into OpenSceneGraph but
missed.
