<PRE>Hi Robert,

Just a heads up that I found a bug in osg::PointSprite().  The GL_POINT_SPRITE_ARB mode is invalid starting in GL3, and core profile will complain about it on console.  The fix is straightforward, I&#8217;m preparing a pull request now.  It does not impact any APIs and should be easy to fit in the release if desired.

Hi Robert,

I&#8217;ve built and have been running OSG 3.6.2-rc1 on several MSVC versions and g++ 4.4 without problems since Wednesday.  Success all around so far.

Hi All,

Since the 3.6.1 stable release went out there have a several bugs picked up and fixed, so I've begun the process of getting a 3.6.2 maintenance release out to wrap these improvements up. There is always a chance that these fixes have introduced regressions, or simply that there are still bugs left to uncover so further community testing of required.  As it hasn't been long since 3.6.1 I'm optimistic that it won't take much to get 3.6.2 ready to go out, I'm hoping to tag the 3.6.2 before the end of next week as I'll be heading off for 10 days holiday right after :-)

First step towards 3.6.2 is our first release candidate:

  <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.6.2-rc1">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.6.2-rc1</A>

Please test across as many build combinations and end user applications as you can.  Could you report success or failures here on this thread so we have an idea of how well things are converging towards the final 3.6.2.

Thanks for you help testing,
Robert.
