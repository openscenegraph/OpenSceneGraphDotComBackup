Didn't think about work for a second :-)

I just love trail running, and covering the 95 miles of the West
Highland Way long distance walking route is a great experience, it's
beautiful route going through the highlands, and the race atmosphere
is great, very much an experience of being among friends than
competitive.  I've completed the race in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, so
was going for my 5th finish.

Alas on Saturday the day didn't go to plan and I ended up with stomach
and sleep deprivation issues so decided to pull out at mile 71, there
was a few high paces left to cover in the dark which I felt was just a
bit too risky without feeling better.  Still had an amazing day, the
discomfort pales into insignificance next to rest of the experience.

Robert.
