well the case of Apple (computer) vs Apple (the music company) was very
similar: a common word and very different industries (at the time Apple was
not in the music/multimedia industry).
And the losers even had the name before Apple Computers was a thing.
IANAL, but I would bet that using Vulkan in the name is not going to be ok.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vulkan&quot; word mark&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Just hoping to avoid future pain here. I can reach out to Khronos if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is what seems best to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The of registered trademarks is something that I have considered, but

</I>&gt;<i> the Vulkan logo colour, font or style in the VulkanSceneGraph logo, not
</I>&gt;<i> that I've really thought too much about that, other than don't be like
</I>&gt;<i> Vulkan.  Branding similar to the OpenSceneGraph would probably make sense
</I>&gt;<i> as they part of the same family.  If we have to then VulcanSceneGraph would
</I>&gt;<i> a bit naff fallback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the branding is very distinct, and the word itself isn't something that

</I>&gt;<i> thought while a lawyer might say ohh absolutely not, in practice I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> they would be unlikely to be able to defend it court.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Within Khronos I suspect there will be a range of views.  Having a
</I>&gt;<i> professional grade scene graph being developed explicitly on top of Vulkan
</I>&gt;<i> is an asset to Vulkan adoption and promotion.  If Kronous want Vulkan to
</I>&gt;<i> break out beyond the game market early adopters then the VulkanSceneGraph
</I>&gt;<i> will be a great vehicle for it.  I could see that some within Khronos might
</I>&gt;<i> concerned that it might be viewed as Khronos project and would detract from
</I>&gt;<i> their own mission, but I'd hope this would be in the minority - or at least
</I>&gt;<i> it should be as Vulkan really needs a professional grade scene graph to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve widespread adoption, and having the Vulkan name in there will a
</I>&gt;<i> great advert for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did look at the costs of trademarking VulkanSceneGraph myself but the
</I>&gt;<i> for worldwide it's several tens of thousands of $ so I decided against it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had considered finding a friendly Khronos member to introduce the
</I>&gt;<i> project to with the hope that they would advocate the project.  If I were
</I>&gt;<i> attending Siggraph this is when I'd do it. I am open to others taking on
</I>&gt;<i> this role if they already have a good working relationship with members of
</I>&gt;<i> Khronos.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Getting an official OK from Khronos would be something more challenging
</I>&gt;<i> and definitely require getting involved with some kinda of committee
</I>&gt;<i> discussion.  Having something tangible to discuss in terms of prototype
</I>&gt;<i> code and design document could be useful in this process so they can have a
</I>&gt;<i> bit of confidence that the project is an asset rather than a risk.  I am
</I>&gt;<i> obviously a few months away from this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Robert.
