<PRE>Hi All,

A PR has just been placed on the openscenegraph github repository:

    <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/567">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/567</A>

I am bit surprised by the need for this PR as I had assumed that the
code base was being rested pretty well under Windows with all the
recent stable release work.

I have asked for the author of the PR for clarification.

I would like to know form the Windows experts in the community about
whether this PR is perfectly fine, or there is some simpler resolution
for this users build combination.

As I'm about to make a 3.6.2 I obviously want the code base to be in
place where it's compiling well for a broad range of users, I'm also
keenly aware that a build fix for one user could be a build break for
many others so am super cautious at this point in time.

Robert.
