If you are more negative and take a more snap judgement outlook, then yes, it means something negative to you. If you you are a more positive person and look for a deeper meaning, you  realize because of biology, that it's actually telling you to have a longer life.

No it doesn't.  It tells me you a steak of obnoxious twat who doesn't
give a shit or don't have a clue how others respond.

Please don't pull this &quot;psychologocal test&quot;, I'm just being &quot;clever&quot;
shit. It's a ugly excuses for being obnoxious. *You* FUCKED up.  It's
seem you haven't got a clue how stupid and insensitive you are.  So
incredibly immature.

There are people out their struggling for physical and mental health,
or have loved ones who they have lost or struggling.  I am not
thankfully in this boat personally but I know people who have, and I
absolutely wouldn't want anyone who is come up this crap.

You have lots all my respect in you choice of name *and* your
response.  It's ugly and toxic.  Is this what you intended?  If so
please leave this community.  If not, then you fucked up but may be
redeemable. First step is realizing out how offensive you've been and
fixing it.

I will not have anything to do with any support for you and will
reject all PR's until you fix this.

Robert.
