<PRE>Hi All,

I am taking a weeks holiday next week so will be offline till 9th of June.

On my return I'm hoping that I won't return to a barrage of &quot;oh dear
now we've tested it 3.6.2 we found it has a bug...&quot; but given this
always happens after a release despite all the calls for testing this
is probably a forlorn hope, is there a rolling eye ascii emoji? You'll
need to make do with a ;-)

I will also look to drawing up a more prominent code of conduct so
that user community know what is deemed acceptable and not acceptable,
something we can using for both OpenSceneGraph and VulkanSceneGraph.
The vast majority of uses are really good net citizen's, some less so.
When you are exposed to so much community interaction as I am even
dealing with the small % interactions that are toxic can be real
blight on quality of life.

On my return I'll also be diving back into Vulkan.  Still very much
learning Vulkan, but am really liking it, as much as I've loved and
supported OpenGL over the decades, Vulkan does directly solve so many
issues that you just have to workaround in OpenGL.  I wouldn't wish
everyone to go through the process of learning the whole of Vulkan,
but for a middle-ware geek like me it's heaven :-)

Cheers,
Robert.
</PRE>
