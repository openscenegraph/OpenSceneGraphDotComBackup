<PRE>Hello Robert and Emmanuel!

I tested this on Windows (3.4.0 OSG, Qt 5.5.1, MSVC2013 32bit).
Screenshot attached in the attachment.

I used insulator dad-0.3.0-windows-vc12x86-testing.exe from my project:

<A HREF="http://dad.podsvirov.pro/">http://dad.podsvirov.pro</A>

What I did:

a) Set the module OpenSceneGraph
b) Launched a console in the folder &quot;bin&quot;
c) Set the environment variable OSG_FILE_PATH (you should be in osg-data)
d) Run &quot;../share/OpenSceneGraph/bin/osgviewerQt.exe

At startup, I got two white Windows, but after small changes in the window using
of the mouse pointer is displayed normally.

Recently I conducted an experiment with OSG 3.5.1 and it worked immediately.

(Soon will upload OSG 3.5.1 installer dad-0.3.0-windows-vc12x64-unstable.exe)

I hope my comments are useful.

Additionally I will say that as part of their project development osgQtQuick (<A HREF="https://github.com/podsvirov/osgqtquick">https://github.com/podsvirov/osgqtquick</A>)
OSG and Ot Quick (Qt5) works fine.

</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to hear Qt/OSG experience has been a bit rough. Qt has been a bit of moving target and generally awkward to work with as it does some odd things with event handling, threading and state. The exact interaction of all of this has changed over time with newer versions of Qt breaking how things used to work, and then fixes to get things working again break how it works with older versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I am not a Qt user so don't have the expertise for tracking these changes and recommending fixes, it is possible to get it working as there are plenty of OSG/Qt users out there. I'm guessing there are mostly just getting on with their work and haven't spotted your request for assistance, or perhaps they don't know enough about the specifics of the combination of OSG/Qt you are using to comment.
