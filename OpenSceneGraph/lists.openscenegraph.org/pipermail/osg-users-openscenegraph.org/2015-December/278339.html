<PRE>Hi All,

New to this list, so forgive me if this has been addressed, but I can't
find any other posts about this issue.

We're unable to build the OSG documentation.  The SDK (bins/includes/libs)
builds and installs just fine, and we're successfully building apps with
the results.  The problem is only with the docs.

doxygen and graphvis seem to be working just fine.  They do run to
completion and do produce html files.  There are a few warnings though.
Here is the output:
---
% make doc_openscenegraph
Warning: doxygen no longer ships with the FreeSans font.
You may want to clear or change DOT_FONTNAME.
Otherwise you run the risk that the wrong font is being used for dot
generated graphs.
/src/OpenSceneGraph/OpenSceneGraph-3.4.0/include/osg/Program:474: warning:
Reached end of file while still inside a (nested) comment. Nesting level 2
(probable line reference: 179, 179)
/src/OpenSceneGraph/OpenSceneGraph-3.4.0/include/osg/Shader:363: warning:
Reached end of file while still inside a (nested) comment. Nesting level 2
(probable line reference: 52, 52)
/src/OpenSceneGraph/OpenSceneGraph-3.4.0/include/osgViewer/View:343:
warning: Reached end of file while still inside a (nested) comment.
Nesting level 2 (probable line reference: 137, 137)
Built target doc_openscenegraph
---

The problem is the resulting pages only contain a listing of &quot;Files&quot; but
no classes or functions.    The &quot;Main Page&quot; only contains a single &quot;Files&quot;
tab, but none of the other tabs (&quot;Namespaces&quot;, &quot;Classes&quot;, etc.).  See
attached screenshot.

I'm using latest versions of CMake/doxygen/grpahivs.

The results are the same under both Windows 7 w/ VisualStudio 2013 and
debian linux w/ gcc 4.9.2.

Also getting the same results whether I invoke the doc build through the
build system (devenv or make), or directly via doxygen on the command
line.

Any tips?

Alternatively, I would be just as happy with a downloadable archive of the
docs that I can install locally, but cannot find any pre-built docs.

Thank you,
Eric
