<PRE>Thanks Robert, excellent answer.

I think I have enough for a way forward now.
One small remaining question,

Does readRefNodeFile access GL at all for any of these file 
formats:&quot;.3ds&quot;,&quot;.dae&quot;,&quot;.shp&quot;,&quot;.dxf&quot;?
Or, to put it another way, can readRefNodeFile be called safely from a 
std:async thread to return something containing a usable osg::Node within 
the main application?

Thanks,

Brian
