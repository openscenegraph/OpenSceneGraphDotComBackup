<PRE>Hi,

I posted some question about OSG performance in the past and now I would like to definitively improve visualization performance of my application.
I want to say that now I already have very good performances with OSG but now I need to start thinking how to manage also some &quot;extreme&quot; scenes.

It is a CAD-like application and a possible scene is composed by some objects (let's say from 1 to some hundreds) each one with 100K to some millions of triangles. 
Each of these objects can have up to some thousands of children each one with around 100 triangles.
For all objects I use vertexbuffer instead of display lists to reduce waiting time at first draw (due to display list compilation).
I use a matrixtransform for each object and few groups for all the scene.
Normally objects are not modified but sometimes they can be modified on the fly by user. So I did not set DataVariance (I supposed it is set automatically to STATIC if I did not modify an object).
The application is GPU bounded as I can see from on-screen stats.

I cannot merge objects or groups into one becouse I need to do some operations on them so I need to keep them separated.
I am using KdTrees to improve object picking, it now works well but the interaction is still not smooth becouse of the slow frame rate.
I think I cannot use LODs becouse triangle reduction on-the-fly can take very long time on this type of scenes.
I tried with osgViewer and more or less it have the same performance of my application.
At the moment I can just show bounding boxes for raw scene manipulation but often I need to show object details.

Could you give me some hint to improve performances? I hope information I give you are enough to do a first analysis.
At the moment I am not able to setup such a scene to send you screenshots of the stats but I can do it in next days if needed.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Ale
