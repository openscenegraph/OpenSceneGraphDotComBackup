&gt;<i> Hi Sebastian,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the prompt reply. As I had written earlier, I do not prefer to generate my road geometries at origin &amp; translate far off where they are located (maybe that&#8217;s the last option that I shall use).
</I>&gt;<i> I am under the impression that there might be other techniques to tackle this problem.
</I>Most likely not. The other problem usually occurring is z-fighting which 
also is a precision problem. This can be tackled via logarithmic depth 
buffers etc. but as you were talking about flickering involving only one 
geometry, depth-precision is non of the problems (For z-fighting you'd 
need at least two primitives).

Think about the problem this way: Your geometry is a _local_ description 
of road-piece that can be _placed_ where you like it to be on a terrain 
that is _placed_ where you like it to be. This way relative coordinates 
will stay in the boundary of your viewing frustum.
And having a road-piece of several thousand kilometers is simply not 
feasible.

&gt;<i> I think, VirtualPlanetBuilder is generating the Terrain Tiles in the way you had written.
</I>&gt;<i> But, FlightGear too has terrain &amp; roads all over &amp; they are rendered properly.
</I>There are several other techniques including texture splatting and so 
on, to put decals onto terrain. But the problem arising with multiple 
geometries on top of each other is usually z-fighting ...

&gt;<i> Do the similar Projects use the same basic theory that you had written?
</I>&gt;<i> It will be helpful if you can give additional insight into this.
</I>There is no way to have coordinates in the scale described in your 
example and single precision. Usually one needs to transform the 
coordinates around the center of the data-set by transforming either the 
geometry coordinates or by using a transform in the scenegraph.
The other, in case relative precision is not-important is to simply 
scale the coordinates. But basically it all boils down to send 
reasonably &quot;small&quot; coordinates to the GPU. Believe me, i had to learn 
this the hard way while implementing shader-based geocentric effects ;-)
This of course doesn't mean that I know every trick.

&gt;<i>
</I>Cheers
Sebastian
