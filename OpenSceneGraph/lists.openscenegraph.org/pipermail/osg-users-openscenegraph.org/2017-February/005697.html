<PRE>Hi Robert,
I've posted questions here and the past and had wonderful responses from you. You've always gave me a response that made me think in order to better understand the problem instead of spoon feeding me like an idiot - and I appreciate that. I also appreciate how you make a rendering engine that is feature packed while relatively easy to use and all at no cost to me.
I guess what I'm really trying to say is thank you for your continued effort even though it means you have to occasionally deal with some of the sorts of bullshit we've seen on this thread.
An appreciative OSG user,Aaron

Hi,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I encourage anyone suggesting that the list moves to some new shiny thing XY, because it is better/nicer/more modern/I don't like e-mail/forum/etc to consider these issues in the future. You are getting free support, so making the life easier for the project leads like Robert is probably the least they can ask for in exchange.
</I>&gt;<i> Meh
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On first sight this place looks kind of meh. It doesn't seem to facilitate anything. Take it from me, I saw this place as an anthill. I wanted to drop my shit, get condescended by Robert. Why do all these new posters have accents and use shitty forum titles that do not lend itself to being searched?
</I>Still that is a problem not being magically solved by using another 
platform/forum. Most of the new posters are simply no native speakers 
and might have a different cultural background. While this might be my 
opinion, I think that this is simply a mirror of our society: People are 
getting lazy to educate themselves, more and more unpolite and simply 
not able to phrase a complex question ...
And honestly you've shown mre rude and unpolite speech and behavior than 
most people here, effectively serving no purpose but &quot;dropping your 
shit&quot;. This is however helping no-one; on the contrary: It might even 
repel those who are willing to sacrifice a share of their spare time.

I personally dislike the forum too, it is a mess compared with a mailing 
list ... but that's maybe me being older than 20 ;-). And you know what 
I did? I became a moderator, to at least help the forum to get a tiny 
bit better...

Cheers
Sebastian
