<PRE>I will jump in with an add as well (please don't be mad at me, it is still
about OSG :-) )

Have a look at <A HREF="http://openig.compro.net/">http://openig.compro.net</A>

It is a very thin and simple Image Generator on top of OSG, opensource as
well, and it does have some features implemented that are common in the
game dev ( I am not a game dev expert though ). Things like Forward+
lighting, env/normal mapping, real physics based sensor support, 3D ocean,
3D clouds, true ephemeris model (some of these rely on commercial toolkits,
used in game dev as well). It also have support for bullet physics
(opensource too), support for large pageable terrain visual databases, even
the whole planet with osgearth. The great thing about this is that OSG is
making it easy to implement such projects in very short term cost effective
by the huge foundation of code and the large community, without the need of
big amount of cash as the others from the game dev will ask you for, like
Havok, Crytek .. It is opensource (oh well, Unreal is opensource too right
:<i>-) )
</I>
So, although OSG is general purpose scenegraph, it is widely used in very
high-end simulation programs (I have seen it it Airbus, Williams Formula 1
and many other simulation companies). But, it is possible to narrow it into
more optimized direction and implement very hacky tricks known from the
game dev. Also, you can find here on this list gurus that can do that in
very professional way.

Just a few words

Cheers,
Nick

</I>&gt;<i> frame. It just wasn't necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Short answer: Scene Graphs of all kinds, including OSG, are often too
</I>&gt;<i> general for the violently performance-competitive realm of AAA game
</I>&gt;<i> development. Titles like those usually get customized tweaks put into the
</I>&gt;<i> actual GRAPHIC DRIVER in order to maximize performance. Long before they
</I>&gt;<i> got to that point, they would have wanted to strip down and redesign the
</I>&gt;<i> entire scene graph to remove ANYTHING they didn't need and optimize the
</I>&gt;<i> rest to one single goal and architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OSG _does_ get used in a variety of independent and lower-tier games where
</I>&gt;<i> development time and cost and efficiency may have a higher importance than
</I>&gt;<i> absolute raw blistering performance.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;
</I>&gt;<i> For your project, OSG should be excellent. Look at Virtual Planet Builder
</I>&gt;<i> and possibly osgEarth for large free-roaming environments. osgEarth could
</I>&gt;<i> save you a decade of man-years of development of high-efficiency large
</I>&gt;<i> terrain area roaming algorithms and code, and it utilizes OSG in the most
</I>&gt;<i> high-performance ways available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want consulting assistance on your project, that's what I do to put
</I>&gt;<i> bread on the table every week. ;)
