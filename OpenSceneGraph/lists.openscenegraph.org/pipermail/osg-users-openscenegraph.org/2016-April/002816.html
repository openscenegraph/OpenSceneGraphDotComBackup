Events before the viewer frame loop have begun should be moot for what
happens in the frame loop, these events may affect state but these should
all be accounted from by the appropriate viewer code prior to the frame
loop.  What happens prior to the frame loop is completely arbitrary and out
of the viewer's directly so it's not something it should be passing on as
events.

The problem here with osgWidget is that it's trying to use events prior to
the frame loop starting as a means of getting state about the windowing
side.  Rather than trying to second guess what the values are for a window
based on events it really should be going directly to the windows
themselves if it wants to account for their state.
