<PRE>

First off, I hope everyone is staying sane and healthy during this pandemic.

 

I&#8217;m working with a collection of 3D models that have come from a variety of 
different source but are now all in osgb format. For several of the models 
I&#8217;d like to grab a &#8220;node&#8221; and apply rotation.

 

As I&#8217;m working through my understanding of the approach, I&#8217;ve created a 
simple application that loads the model, traverses the scene, returns a 
pointer to the &#8220;node&#8221;, casts to a DOFTransform and manipulate the &#8220;node&#8221; 
(DOFTransform). Snippet:

FindNamedNodeVisitor fnnv(&quot;turret&quot;);

scene-&gt;accept(fnnv);

osg::ref_ptr&lt;osgSim::DOFTransform&gt; dofTrans = new osgSim::DOFTransform();

dofTrans = 
dynamic_cast&lt;osgSim::DOFTransform*&gt;(fnnv.getFoundNode()-&gt;asTransform());

if(dofTrans != NULL)

                                //manipulate (rotate)   

 

This approach works for the tank.osg model. Now I&#8217;m trying to apply this 
approach to a different model (helicopter for example). When I access the 
&#8220;node&#8221; of interest, &#8220;Main_Hub&#8221; which is an osg::Group I obviously can&#8217;t 
cast that to a osgSim::DOFTransform. I&#8217;m trying to get an understand of how 
I can change the model, now in osgt (readable) format, to a structure that 
can be used. I&#8217;ve been using the tank.osg as a guide and attempted to 
recreate a similar structure in the helicopter.osgt. I&#8217;m trying to take 
logical stabs in the dark, in the helicopter model I&#8217;ve attempted to simply 
renamed the &#8220;node&#8221; of interest from an osg::Group to osgSim::DOFTransform. 
The model still displays correctly, but the cast to osgSim::DOFTransform 
returns NULL. I thought there may be some required variables at are needed 
as part of the osgSim::DOFTransform structure, so I began adding 
currentHPR, currentTranslate, and currentScale and continued to add more 
bringing it in line with the tank.osg example. Through all the attempts I 
still getting NULL when casting.

 

I&#8217;m looking for any guidance/suggestions/lessons learned on how to properly 
do this.


Thanks in advance

 

Jeremy
