<PRE>Hi Jeremy, 

 

As your geometry-parts are usually under a transform /group you can use a NodeVisitor to collect those (Find the nodes by name) and replace them with a DOF-Transform. 

You could of course also mess with the osgt-files, but that would be a last resort. 

 

Cheers

Sebastian

Subject: [osg-users] Edit 3D (osgt) model to add DOFTransform and perform &quot;node&quot; rotation

 

First off, I hope everyone is staying sane and healthy during this pandemic.

 

I&#8217;m working with a collection of 3D models that have come from a variety of different source but are now all in osgb format. For several of the models I&#8217;d like to grab a &#8220;node&#8221; and apply rotation.

 

As I&#8217;m working through my understanding of the approach, I&#8217;ve created a simple application that loads the model, traverses the scene, returns a pointer to the &#8220;node&#8221;, casts to a DOFTransform and manipulate the &#8220;node&#8221; (DOFTransform). Snippet:

FindNamedNodeVisitor fnnv(&quot;turret&quot;);

scene-&gt;accept(fnnv);

osg::ref_ptr&lt;osgSim::DOFTransform&gt; dofTrans = new osgSim::DOFTransform();

dofTrans = dynamic_cast&lt;osgSim::DOFTransform*&gt;(fnnv.getFoundNode()-&gt;asTransform());

if(dofTrans != NULL)

                                //manipulate (rotate)   

 

This approach works for the tank.osg model. Now I&#8217;m trying to apply this approach to a different model (helicopter for example). When I access the &#8220;node&#8221; of interest, &#8220;Main_Hub&#8221; which is an osg::Group I obviously can&#8217;t cast that to a osgSim::DOFTransform. I&#8217;m trying to get an understand of how I can change the model, now in osgt (readable) format, to a structure that can be used. I&#8217;ve been using the tank.osg as a guide and attempted to recreate a similar structure in the helicopter.osgt. I&#8217;m trying to take logical stabs in the dark, in the helicopter model I&#8217;ve attempted to simply renamed the &#8220;node&#8221; of interest from an osg::Group to osgSim::DOFTransform. The model still displays correctly, but the cast to osgSim::DOFTransform returns NULL. I thought there may be some required variables at are needed as part of the osgSim::DOFTransform structure, so I began adding currentHPR, currentTranslate, and currentScale and continued to add more bringing it in line with the tank.osg example. Through all the attempts I still getting NULL when casting.

 

I&#8217;m looking for any guidance/suggestions/lessons learned on how to properly do this.

 

Thanks in advance

 

Jeremy
