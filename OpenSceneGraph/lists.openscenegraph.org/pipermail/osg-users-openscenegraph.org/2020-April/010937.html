<PRE>Laurens, thanks for the reply; 
 

&gt;<i> &gt; What would I need to do to have the attribute not applied?
</I>&gt;<i>   Remove it from your osgt file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The rationale for keeping it in our osgt file is that we use those values 
to set them to the uniforms in the shaders. I guess we could toss them once 
we have read them and applied them to the shader.

Would there be a way to keep them there and not have them applied?

I admit that this is not the biggest of the issues I'm facing with trying 
to use 4.2 in our software.
