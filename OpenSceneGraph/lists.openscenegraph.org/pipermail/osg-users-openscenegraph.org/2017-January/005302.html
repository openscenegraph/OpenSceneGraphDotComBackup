<PRE>Hi Robert,

Implementation librocket, which are published them in order. Problem is only in the GUI display is on the node that rotates around the axis XYZ. Myself but needs to appear as a 2D GUI, something like over the base OSG viewport. I should if you would like to display scores and other information in the game, so I do not want the information to be rotated in any direction but to always shows at front. Of course this applies also to menus, settings, etc. ... OSG'm not so good, I learn, so do not know how do I do this. I tried to add another camera and to hang it on the GUI but I failed. It is surprisingly interesting that any other GUI has a problem with that it is not possible, or is it difficult to implement 3D as a way librocket again not possible to implement a 2D? Due to poor English and lack of tutorial and guidance in my language, I do not fail. Should you ever been so good and tried to advise how to do it, it would be cool.

Thank you!

Cheers,
Denis
