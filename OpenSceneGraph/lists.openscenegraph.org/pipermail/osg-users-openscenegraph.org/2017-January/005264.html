&gt;<i> Hi,How to avoid the Fatal nb colors error in texture images.
</I>
I am sure I'm not the only one who is often completely confused by
your posts.  I have no clue what you mean by &quot;Fatal nb colors error&quot;,
it's just like a random collection of words put in a single sentence.

This example of confusing or meaning free post is not unique amongst
your posts, are large large percentage of your posts are really hard
to pick out what you actually mean, and what the actual problem might
be.

The Language barrier could be part of the issue, I don't know whether
this is a particular problem in your case, I certainly don't envy
others in the world who ended up having to try to get support in a
language other than their native tongue.  I'm in awe of those out in
the community at just how well a bunch of computer geeks get by
despite English not being their first language.  English is my first
language and I struggle...

If language is a particular problem then try to support your questions
with pictures/models, copy and pasting the exactly warnings/errors you
are seeing rather than trying to paraphrase as clearly this is failing
as all too often you common out with sentences that are impossible to
make any sense from.

Also before you send any post take a step back, think about the
problem you have, think about what information others would need to
understand what you see in front of you, we aren't omnipotent, we
can't see what you've done.

This isn't the first time that I have asked you to put more effort
into your posts to the forum, normally if had to provide such advice
to members of the community in the past they fix the problematic style
of posts and posts there after are much easier to follow and provide
support to.  This hasn't yet worked for you, so I'm a lost to what the
specific problem is, why part of convey problems clearly is a
struggle.

Fixing this problem of communicating issues will be far more important
to address than the immediate technical issue that you have in front
of you.  There will also be technical issue that pop up from time to
time, you need to fix the communication issues.  If there are specific
reasons that your struggle on the communication front then tell us and
we might be able to provide pointers.

What we can't do is keep on with the current approach you have towards
the community, it's painful for us, unhelpful to you, and is a poor
example to the rest of the community.

Robert.
