Building on an ocean?  House boats?

Using any tool?  Will a screw driver do?

You really are an exceptional example of how a poorly functioning AI
might attempt to build sentences by stringing together random words
and phrases that other peoples have used in unrelated contexts.

We can only guess at what you actually mean.

Best guesses:

  3D Building Models?

       Welll just load them like any other model in the OSG. If there
is plugin for the format.  To place it in the correct place just stick
a transform node above it.

       Whether there is plugin for it I cannot not say, despite
repeated questions about what you mean have have never said what
format the buildings are in.  This is basic information. why never
tell us?

   On the Ocean?

      Do you understand what an ocean is? It's no typically somewhere
you put buildings.  However, if you did have an oil rig on something
similar then loading and model and placing a transform above it
      works just in the same way as on dry land.

This is basic stuff. It doesn't take much initiative or background
research to find answers to loading a 3D model and placing it in a
scene.  Telling us basic information in your posts is also a very
basic skill and courtesy, you have already been asked many times to
provide clearer explanations of what you are attempting.  The fact
that you continue to put so little effort in explaining yourself is no
longer something we can put down to inexperience but rather wilful
ignorance or a level of skills that will always be hurdle to learning
anything related to computer graphics.

Personally I not going to provide any more support to you.  It's just
too painful to try and drag out even the very simplest bit of
information, I've tried to encourage you to provide better
interactions with the community so they are more productive and have
completely failed, you posts are just as bad now as your first
stumbling steps with the community.  You simply don't seem cut out for
computer graphics and being part of an open source community.
