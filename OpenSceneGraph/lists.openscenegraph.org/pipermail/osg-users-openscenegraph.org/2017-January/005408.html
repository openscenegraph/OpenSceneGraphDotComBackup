<PRE>Hey guys,

Digging deeper into this issue, I found in the mail header:

X-Report-Abuse: You can also report abuse here:
 <A HREF="https://sable.madmimi.com/abuse/new?id=64170.233867.1.89772119f10a5f14edc461729ba36bd9">https://sable.madmimi.com/abuse/new?id=64170.233867.1.89772119f10a5f14edc461729ba36bd9</A>

So I went to that URL and filled out the abuse form, this is what I filled in:

&quot;Unsolicited email is being sent to every mailing list subscriber of the osg-users mailing list  whenever they make a post.

It appears as if a certain user has subscribed to the mailing list with a customer service mail address that creates new incident IDs for every mail received. Please block this user from your service.&quot;

There's another form when you google for &quot;secureserver.net abuse&quot;, here: <A HREF="https://supportcenter.secureserver.net/AbuseReport/Index">https://supportcenter.secureserver.net/AbuseReport/Index</A> , so I filled that one out as well.

Please everyone who receive this mail fill out the form as well. Hopefully that'll make it stop.
