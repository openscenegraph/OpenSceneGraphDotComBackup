USA


Pervasive Simulation for Enhanced Decision Making


The Summer Simulation Multi-Conference 2017 (SummerSim&#146;17) is a combination
of the Summer Computer Simulation Conference (SCSC)
&lt;<A HREF="https://sites.google.com/site/scsc2017/">https://sites.google.com/site/scsc2017/</A>&gt;  and the
&lt;<A HREF="http://atc.udg.edu/SPECTS2017/">http://atc.udg.edu/SPECTS2017/</A>&gt; International Symposium on Performance
Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunications Systems (SPECTS). SummerSim is
SCS&#146;s premier international conference in cooperation with ACM SIGSIM. The
conference focuses on modeling and simulation, tools, theory, methodologies
and applications and provides a forum for the latest R&amp;D results in academia
and industry. This year&#146;s focus is on the pervasive role of simulation
tools, methodologies and technologies for enabling a more informed and
effective online decision making. We encourage you to take this opportunity
to experience the tutorials, tracks, and workshops that will be available.
Click here &lt;<A HREF="https://sites.google.com/site/scsc2017/">https://sites.google.com/site/scsc2017/</A>&gt;  for additional
information. 

A selected group of the best papers of SummerSim 2017 will be published in a
special issue &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/systems/special_issues/psedm">http://www.mdpi.com/journal/systems/special_issues/psedm</A>&gt;  of
Systems &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/systems">http://www.mdpi.com/journal/systems</A>&gt; . All manuscripts will be
subject to the journal&#146;s normal process of evaluation for suitability for
peer review. Please note that acceptance of a paper in SummerSim 2017 does
not imply acceptance of an accompanying paper for publication in the special
issue.

Authors of accepted papers are expected to attend the conference, present
their work to their peers, transfer copyright, and pay a conference
registration fee at the time their camera-ready paper is submitted. All
papers will be included in the conference proceedings and archived in both
the SCS digital library and the ACM Digital Library, and will be indexed in
DBLP and SCOPUS.

Computer Graphics for Simulation (CGS&#146;17) [Paper Track at the Summer
Computer Simulation Conference 2017]

TRACK OVERVIEW

Simulations can consist of focused physical simulations to complex
interconnected systems. Simulations can be used to produce 

numbers. Some simulations can produce theories of human behaviors. Other
simulations test security while others investigate 

industrial control. In some cases the result is just a number or statistic.
In many cases, the results are anthropomorphic. Many 

simulations use graphics to  present the results. Many simulations use
virtual objects to represent the input to simulations. In many 

cases, the simulation must be visualized to reveal useful patterns in
processes and models.

 

This paper track is designed to elicit papers that present novel results in
simulation interoperability and visualization. The paper  track focuses on
several topic areas. The General Computer Graphics topic area is designed to
solicit papers that apply state of the art graphics techniques and image
processing to visualizing simulation results and simulation virtual
environments. The Web3D / WebGL / HTML5 topic  area is designed to extract
from the research community, state of the art techniques for visualizing
distributed simulations. Many physically based simulations require solutions
of complex systems of equations that must have efficient computational grids
to produce realistic results with minimal computer resources. Simulation
methodologies for data acquisition for the Internet Of Things (IoT) is a
topic of interest. Maplesim, Labview, COMSOL, Simulink, System Modeler are
system examples of IoT with domain specific languages of interest to the
track.

 

WebGL, GPGPU computing and HTML5 are now established hot topics in Computer
Graphics heavily promoted at SIGGRAPH 2016 and previous Web3D, Graphics and
SIGGRAPH conferences.

track, navigate to the LIST OF SYMPOSIUM, TRACKS AND CALL FOR PAPERS section
of <A HREF="http://scs.org/summersim/.">http://scs.org/summersim/.</A> Click on the Computer Graphics for Simulation
Paper Track &#147;CGS call for Paper&#148; link.

FINAL NOTE: In the LIST OF SYMPOSIUM, TRACKS AND CALL FOR PAPERS there are
many absolutely totally worthy Paper Tracks for your consideration
.

 

FYI: Great conferences always have a place for qualified paper reviewers.
Contact the program committee or the various track chairs if you are
interested in contributing to the success of the international simulation
community peer review process.
