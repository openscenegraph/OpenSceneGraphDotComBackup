Oh well, that exhausts one possibility of a fix.

I don't really know if it's worth trying to fix osgText::Text, when I
made the changes to support VAO I got things working under Linux, or
at least it appeared to be working, but osgText::Text implementation
is a real mess internally due to several early design decisions based
on limitations of hardware 15 years back then a series of contribution
that added extra features to Text but also with lots of complexities.

To properly fix it I feel that it might even be worth making
osgText::Text and full node and have it generate a subgraph (made with
standard osg::Geometry etc.) to do the actual rendering rather than
embed it all in a custom Drawable as is done now.  The problem would
be backwards compatibility.

I have too much other work on right now to dive into topic, but have a
think about  the issues when I do have time.

Robert.
