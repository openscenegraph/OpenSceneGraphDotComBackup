<PRE>Hi All,

I have just merged into master some changes to
osgUtil::GLObjectVisitor to help with tracking down GL errors in a
more fine grained way.  This will be better for pinpointing GL errors
that are occurring in your application.

The GLObjectVisitor does the pre-compile at the start of viewer but
previously didn't do any calls to check, so previously the GL errors
wouldn't be checked until the application got into the main loop
previously.  All the users would get would be a report of GL invald
operation being detected after a completely unrelated set operations.

The ABI of osgUtil has changed very slightly with this change so
you'll need to rebuild the OSG and your application otherwise you'll
risk a crash.

I know this will help users as I've been hit up against some GL errors
that are difficult to trace in the OSG and application development
over the years.

Cheers,
Robert.
</PRE>
