<PRE>Hi Robert,

Sorry for the delay, but I am definitely interested in trying to find a time and day to meet up around the dulles area. A couple of my coworkers are interested in joining as well. We are a little closer to the DC area, just off the beltway. I know the area well, so once we pick a day/time I can help with suggestions on places to go.

Would you prefer to stay in the Dulles area, or are you willing to head out towards the beltway? Also did you prefer to meet up over dinner, drinks, both or something else? There are a few places near you that have many venues, One Loudoun, Fairfax Town Center, Reston Town Center, to name a few.Lastly, I personally won't be able to meet up Friday or Saturday evening as I had plans from months ago, but should be flexible any other day/evening, including tonight.

Let us know what works for you and I'll relay to the rest of my coworkers. I appreciate the effort in trying to organize something with the community and I hope we can find something that can work. Talk to you soon.

... 

Cheers,
Alex
