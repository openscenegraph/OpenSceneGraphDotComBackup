<PRE>Hi All,

Below is an &quot;Issue&quot; posted on the openscengraph github page from an
non OSG developer touting for us to integrate the OSG with the Conan
C++ depency manager.

Personally, I'm not familiar with Conan, I have no use for itself
myself, I guess it might be useful to some in the community.  I don't
have time to go chasing it up myself as I have way too much on my
plate already, so I'll defer to the community as to whether it's worth
pursuing and doing any legwork required.

As it's really not an &quot;Issue&quot; relating to the OSG but a sales pitch it
really isn't appropriate place to clog up out Issue list so I'll be
closing it, but thought it be better at least tell the community about
it before I do so.

If you are interested than please look into it and report back to us
about what steps would need to be taken add the OSG into Conan mix.

Cheers,
Robert.

Hello,
Do you know about Conan?
Conan is modern dependency manager for C++. And will be great if your
library will be available via package manager for other developers.

Here you can find example, how you can create package for the library.

If you have any questions, just ask :-)
