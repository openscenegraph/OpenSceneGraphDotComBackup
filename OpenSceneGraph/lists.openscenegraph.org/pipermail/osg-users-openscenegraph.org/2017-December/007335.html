<PRE>Hi All,

I'll be out in Dulles, Virginia for work between the 10th and 16th
December.  I don't often make it out to the states so thought if there
are other OSG users in the area we could get together either in one of
my non working days or one evening for dinner.

I'll be arrive late on Saturday 10th, will have Sunday 11th free but
likely will be jet lagged and wanting to do final prep bit could do
meet up for a meal.  I'll be working Monday through Thursday, I could
possible done an evening meal meeting during this time but I'll likely
be pretty tired and wanting to rest my voice.

Friday 15th I should have free, and will be around most of Saturday
16th as I'll be flying out in the evening from Dulles airport.

So anyone in the area?  Want to meet up?

I don't know Dulles area so will require those more local for
suggestions on venue.

Cheers,
Robert.
</PRE>
