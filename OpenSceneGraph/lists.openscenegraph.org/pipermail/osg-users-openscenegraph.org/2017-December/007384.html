<PRE>Hi Robert,

I have come accross a similar issue. I am working on a GtkmmOsgViewer for gtkmm3. I have found this is to be quite challenging and was not able to use new Gtk::GLArea widget for this. Perhaps someone with better knowledge of OpenGL than myself could solve that problem. The code from examples/osgviewerGTK was useful however I decided to follow a slightly different approach.

I create pBuffer context and attach image to main camera. Then after each frame I redraw the image onto the cairo surface of the widget using cairo_image_surface_create_for_data() similar to osgPlugins/pdf/ReaderWriterPDF.cpp . So far I have been creating an oversized PixelBuffer and only using a subset of it, this avoids re-creating the context each time the widget is resized. I also have to set camera-&gt;RenderTargetImplementation(FRAME_BUFFER); as this is the only option that gives me image with transparency alpha values. The other implementations ignore alpha.

My problems are:

&#8226; I am unable to achieve multisampling of the image. I've tried setting traits-&gt;samples = 4; and also samples on camera-&gt;attach(COLOR_BUFFER, image, 4 /* samples */); . I have tried setting a scaled up viewport, for example scale = 4, and letting cairo downsample to achieve antialiasing. This is however very slow (in frame time) since CPU is used for this downsampling operation. How can I achieve multisampling for the attached image? 

&#8226; I think your advice &quot;using a single PixelBuffer and then using a FrameBufferObject within this to do the rendering to and copying from&quot; is great. Could you please explain how to do this? Are there any specific considerations for multisampling?


Looking forward to your answer.

Cheers,
Giorge
