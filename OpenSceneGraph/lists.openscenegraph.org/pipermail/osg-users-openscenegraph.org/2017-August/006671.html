<PRE>Hi Tobias,

Paged databases tend to be quite a bit larger than the source imagery as GL
texture compression is not as efficient memory wise compared to tiff/jpeg,
instead it's designed for high GPU performance so it's usually an
appropriate trade off for real-time visualization.

VirtualPlanetBuilder is written specifically for very large datasets, a
paged database of 300GB is actually quite modest, multi-terabyte databases
are common when dealling which lots of high res data across the globe.  VPB
has support for generating databases using a cluster of machines to help
with work in generating the databases.  Reading, processing and writing to
disk large amounts of data is rather intensive though, so build times can
be quite large.

The focus of VPB is not build speed but generating high performance, large
scale paged databases, so you build a few times, but run your visualization
application many times.

If real-time performance isn't so critical but you would like to avoid the
paged database build time then osgEarth might be the tool to use.

Personally, if you have the disk space and the runtime performance is
working well then I'd just build a paged database with all the data you
have to high level required (VPB automatically stops build once full res
has been achieved) and just have fun,

If you don't have the disk space then there are things you can look at, but
at this stage I don't see any reason not to just go with a full res
database.

Robert.
