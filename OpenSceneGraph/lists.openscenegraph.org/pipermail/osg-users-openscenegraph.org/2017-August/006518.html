The PagedLOD node has get methods that tell you what children are loaded, a
custom NodeVisitor could traverse it's subgraphs.  There are also PagedLOD
methods that allow you to check the last frame number that a child was
traversed.  Have no clue whether any of these are appropriate but given the
following question I'm perplex why the above question is relevant to the
later at all.


&gt;<i> I need this to determine if a plugin was loaded or not.

Surely one would check osgDB::Registry for the plugins that have been
loaded rather than the scene graph?  The osgDB::Registry is what manages
plugins, the scene graph loaded by the plugins don't have any connection
back to the plugins.

I remain perplexed why you are asking about this task in the way you have,
perhaps it would be best to take a step back and tell us what specific
problem you have to solve rather than trying to second guess what the
solution might be and then asking a questions based on these assumed
solutions.  In general if we get users with perplexing questions it's
typically due to them getting ahead of themselves w.r.t how to solve tasks,
and asking the how to solve the task from a high level description is far
easier to answer given the knowledge of the community.

Robert.
