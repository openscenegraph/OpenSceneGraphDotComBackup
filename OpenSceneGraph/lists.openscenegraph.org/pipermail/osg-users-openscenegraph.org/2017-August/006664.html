<PRE>Hi All,
I have two applications where I create the same graphics in two different ways. Both have some performance issues. Please see attached images with the stats.

In the first application I create the graphics from an obj file. So the work is done by the OSG obj plugin. There are about 5 milion vertices and 10 milion primitives. I guess DL are used.
The frame rate in this case is quite low (~7 fps). GPU usage does not seem a big bottleneck (~18 ). But the graphics rotation and zoom is not smooth. Frame rate, GPU and DRAW usage remain pretty much the same afer zooming in.

In my second application I build the geometry by my own since the source file format is proprietary. I use VBO and split geometry in chunks of 29997 elements: that's why for the same graphics I have 332 geometry nodes. Moreover since the user can change the color of a single triangle I have to bind color array PER_VERTEX, and vertices are not shared between triangles. That's why the number of vertices is about 3 times the number of primitives (9.6M - 28.9M).
The frame rate is not bad (~26 fps) but GPU usage is higher wrt the first application (~33). On the contrary DRAW operations are faster.
The good point of the second application is that zooming in I get a good increasing of the frame rate (~59 fps), while GPU and DRAW decrease.

Now, the second application seems better on the everage but I would like to improve the frame rate when the whole geometry is visible on the viewer. I gave a look at LOD implementation but osgUtil::Simplifier is quite slow with a huge mesh. So is there any other way to solve this issue?

About the first application, which is way you suggest to increase the frame rate?

Thanks in advance,
Gianni
