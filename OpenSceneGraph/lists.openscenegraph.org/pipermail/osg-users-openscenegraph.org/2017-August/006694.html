Ahhhhhh, sorry but you just don't seem to grasping it, the OSG fully
supports setting the view and projection matrices in GLES2 and GL3+ core
profile, you don't need to add ANY more complexity than just replacing
gl_ModelView* with osg_ModelView*, the OSG will even automatically remap
for you.

The OSG automatically accumulates all view and projection matrices for you,
sets the when required, it does a shed load of work for you to make you
life easy.  All the osg::Camera and osg::Transform subclasses all work in
coherent and robust fashion, whether you are using fixed function pipeline
of shaders and they function in the same way in both.

This capability is massive strength of the OSG.

I can't help but feel you are making a massive deal from your own
mis-understandings and see restrictions where there aren't any.  Just use
the OSG, while it's not perfect, the flaws it has aren't related to
management of modelview and projection martrices, this has all been working
well in fixed function and shaders for a decade, it's a solved problem.

If all this power and convinience is not for then please go right your own
scene graph as I really shouldn't have to keep replying to a pointless
thread where the solutions are already provided.

Robert.
