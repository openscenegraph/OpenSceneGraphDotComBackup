<PRE>Hi Robert,

Good to know and I will probably prune the GLUT library from my supported libraries in time.

In the mean time, I have managed to work around the issue. There was a change to the glut.h file in the official github repo last year that introduced some preprocessor variables which changes the ways the library gets linked. Now you need to specify that you are linking with a static library in the parent project. Previously this was handled silently. Visual Studio users now need to set their runtime library option to /MT instead of /MD to be able to link with the static version of the library.

My quick workaround was to make the shared library the default option. And if someone tries to build the static library they will get a small warning of what to change in their project to be able to link correctly.

Regards
Bj&#246;rn

Hi Pete,

You can try my CMake scripts:

There seems to be some problems with GLUT library, at least on my machine. But except from that I think that all of the latest third party libraries are working correctly with Visual Studio 2017 update 3.

I don't know if it helps but the OSG master no longer uses GLUT as I've removed the GLUT example.

Robert.
