</I>Mh yeah my quick reaction was just that as opposed to other fields in 
the DisplaySettings, the desired OpenGL context version is likely to be 
a constant thoughout the lifetime of the application.

</I>Admittedly, I'm not very familiar with OpenSceneGraph, my main 
motivation digging into this is just to get osgEarth working again under 
Linux, as it has been broken for the past couple of years ever since it 
started requiring GLSL330+.

That said, I found it confusing and it took me some time to figure out 
how to actually set the glContextVersion etc. The DisplaySettings had no 
effect, and only after digging into the code I realized that it was 
because osgEarth creates its version without specifying a 
DisplaySettings instance [1]. After becoming more familiar with the 
internal workings, I suppose this can be classified as a bug in 
osgEarth, but I feel that a user new to OSG could expect that the 
settings specified in the global DisplaySettings singleton actually have 
an effect on the Traits if it is constructed without a specific ds 
instance passed.


Just my thoughts.

Sandro
