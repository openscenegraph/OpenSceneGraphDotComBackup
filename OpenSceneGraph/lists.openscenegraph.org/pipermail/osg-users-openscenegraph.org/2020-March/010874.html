<PRE>Hi Armin,
Essentially the scene graph is a one-for-one representation of my DOM. Each 
individual object can be edited, or its attributes changed. 
The DOM can be a small number of geometrically &quot;complex&quot; objects  - this 
causes no performance problems as the geometry &quot;leafs&quot; are large 
geometrically, or the DOM might have a large number of simple objects.

A KD tree would be useful for removing &quot;not visible&quot; nodes, but in general 
they are all visible.

In &quot;theory&quot; the  whole scene graph geometry was flattened to one set of 
vertex, colors and normals for maximum efficiency - of course, updates to 
the scene graph would require this structure to be partially or fully 
rebuilt.

That's a bit of overkill for me, as I &quot;know&quot; the parent Group node in the 
scene graph that I want to make more efficient. Typically the objects under 
this node have the same attributes. 

I could flatten my nodes &quot;manually&quot;, but flattening the scene graph seems a 
typical &quot;use-case&quot; that OSG users would want to do.

I have done some tests with osg::Optimizer with the MERGE_GEOMETRY option 
after collecting all the osg::Geometry nodes into a temporary group -  this 
does not do exactly what I want, as it only collects the 
osg::PrimitiveSets. Not merging the sets themselves.
Weirdly calling &quot;optimize&quot; also causes my scene graph to stop drawing for 
some unknown and very frustrating reason.

There is a lot of code in the OSG GLES plugin code that looks promising, 
but it's quite undocumented and I am having to guess about it's 
functionality.
