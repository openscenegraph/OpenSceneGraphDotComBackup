<PRE>I had for a good long time an error that sounds similar to this. We had *timeBeginPeriod 
*set pretty low, to like 1. Turns out this was causing a lot of 
dead-locking in the NVidia driver. I have also found NVIDIA Nsight to be 
pretty useful for tracking down some issues with hangs. We had another 
issue where a 3rd party lib we were using made a few unneeded glGetInt 
calls every frame. This seemed to cause some intermittent long hangs when 
we ran multiple instances of our program at the same time. I was able to 
find this one pretty quickly with Nsight.
