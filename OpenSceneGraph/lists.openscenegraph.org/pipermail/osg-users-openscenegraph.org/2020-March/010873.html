<PRE>Iterating over the 5000 children would be pretty slow - what if you could
discard some of these children without even looking at them? A hierarchy of
sorts, where you can ignore large swaths of those children, would help...
Consider, for example, using a k-d tree:
<A HREF="../../../../www.openscenegraph.com/index.php/documentation/user-guides/107-kdtrees.html">http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/documentation/user-guides/107-kdtrees</A>

Or you can do this on your own, if you like, by grouping nearby nodes into
their own osg::Group. Depends what your underlying data looks like.



I would not recommend combining the geometry into a single drawable unless
you expect all of them to be visible at once, and that each piece of
geometry is fairly small.
