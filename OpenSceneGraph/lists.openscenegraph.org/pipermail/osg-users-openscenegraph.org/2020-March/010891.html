Do you see any OpenGL errors reported?  The OSG checks once per frame for
errors.

There are places where values are checked but there isn't a specific class
for general checking of validity of data, such errors are so open ended I
don't think you have one validator to rule them all.

One way of checking things is to convert the data to that ascii .osgt
format using osgconv and then inspect the data to see if there are any
oddities.  The files could be quite large so I'd suggest starting with
small models that you know are causing problems and have a look at these
first.

It would also be worth trying things out on a different OS, hardware,
drivers etc, to see if there are any correlations.

In essence you need to try out different strategies to tease out the cause
of the problem, once you understand the specifics of the problem you can
start to craft a solution.
