  Everything I described as far as the bounding-sphere clipping is done
automatically.


&gt;<i> -I had guessed that rear face culling was something inside, and automatic.

</I>
It is, unless you disable it.


&gt;<i> -I take it to be the case that pre-draw coincidence occlusion doesn't

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes. They are not drawn in any particular order, OpenGL normally just
relies on the Z buffer to sort out obscuring things.

If you have transparent/translucent objects, you can tell OSG to sort them
by distance so that they are drawn furthest to nearest, in order to make
transparency sort of work.

If you want to use OpenGL's occlusion culling extensions, there are some
examples out there of how to do this in OSG. However, usually you need some
fairly complex objects with a lot of depth layers before it's worthwhile.


&gt;<i> -There is a 2D user interface widgets package that now comes as part of
</I>&gt;<i> OSG.  IS this just an inclusion of wxwidgets?  What is is the name of this
</I>&gt;<i> toolkit?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
  It is not wxWidgets. It's a simple 2D widget system. I don't know too
many people using it.
