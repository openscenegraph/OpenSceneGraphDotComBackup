<PRE>Hi Robert,

Thanks for the explanation. I'm still puzzled by the question which 
elements can be updated in the update-phase without setting them to 
dynamic. I always was under the impression, that the update is performed 
before cull/draw are actually executed.
Right now I need some thread safe &quot;time slot&quot; to change the scene graph 
in terms of inserting nodes, updating transforms etc. I guess it is 
totally okay to do this in the update callback/operation.
But for changes to images, text, an arrays of drawables I need to set 
them to DYNAMIC if I understood you correctly. So basically what I got 
is, that I could put the draw of those elements as far to beginning of 
the draw as possible.

As for the double buffering: Can it be done at drawable level? Like 
swapping the front/back drawable back and forth, effectively doubling 
the geometry/image space needed?

Cheers
Sebastian

</I>&gt;<i>     threading models. Anyway,  what I know for sure is that update and
</I>&gt;<i>     draw traversal can indeed execute in parallel within some
</I>&gt;<i>     threading models, and that is the reason why we need DYNAMIC
</I>&gt;<i>     variance, to tell drawing thread it must process dynamic elements
</I>&gt;<i>     first, and then immediately allow execution of the update
</I>&gt;<i>     traversal in a main thread while STATIC elements are still being
</I>&gt;<i>     rendered in a draw thread. I also suspect that next frame cannot
</I>&gt;<i>     start before all the static+dynamic elements are rendered. If I'm
</I>&gt;<i>     correct on this one, then few DYNAMIC elements should not affect
</I>&gt;<i>     frame rate at all, because there is plenty of time to do the
</I>&gt;<i>     processing while STATIC elements are still being rendered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the DrawThreadPerContext and 
</I>&gt;<i> DrawThreadPerContextCullThreadPerCamera threading models the static 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the rendering can be done in parallel with the next frame.  
</I>&gt;<i> You guess this correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The one thing I'd add is that the OSG itself doesn't attempt to sort 
</I>&gt;<i> DYNAMIC objects so that are drawn first. You can set up your 
</I>&gt;<i> StateSet::RenderBinDetails to force the dynamic objects to be drawn 
</I>&gt;<i> first, but you can only do this for objects that don't affect the 
</I>&gt;<i> rendering of other objects, or are affected by what is the fame buffer 
</I>&gt;<i> already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of text it has to be placed in the depth sorted bin which 
</I>&gt;<i> is drawn after the main opaque bin, so if there are text objects set 
</I>&gt;<i> to DYNAMIC then you stop the next frame from start till the end of 
</I>&gt;<i> dispatch of the last depth sorted dynamic object.  This may well be 
</I>&gt;<i> very near the end of the draw dispatch so you come pretty close to 
</I>&gt;<i> nullifying all the capacity for running the draw thread in parallel 
</I>&gt;<i> with the next frames' update and cull traversals.  This is likely the 
</I>&gt;<i> situation for Sebastian.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using double buffering of Text object's is probably the best way to 
</I>&gt;<i> avoid updating a Text object while it's being drawn, allowing the Text 
</I>&gt;<i> DataVariance to remain STATIC. Such double buffering could be done a 
</I>&gt;<i> custom Node that has two Text objects, one for current frame being 
</I>&gt;<i> updated, and one for the previous frame still being rendered.
