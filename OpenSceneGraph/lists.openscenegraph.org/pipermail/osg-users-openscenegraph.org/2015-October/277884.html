<PRE>Dear Robert,
first of all thank you very much for taking your precious time to answer and give your advice: we appreciate very much.
Looks like there's not too much interest in osgOcean progress in this period.
Or maybe for other people it works nicely as it is.
Our environment, as I've explained to you a few days ago, is a complex application scenario with terrestrial, above and underwater articulated vehicles, all interactive or driven by internal simulations or external telemetries, all fully dynamic with a few scenario's options preconfigured.

And for sure our own powerful bugs (they come for free but shhhh... don't tell anybody or people will ask only for those).

For what regards opening a github, well, in this moment we don't have the means to give the right assistance to people who may download ocean from our repository and consequently might need to have explanations on topics and usage of the whole, which is far beyond our current knowledge and time availability.

Let's say that, for now, everybody can read we have some patches to compile osgOcean with 3.4.0 and that we've found some bugs on the code which affects overall stability.
If anyone has similar troubles can try to contact us.
In the mean time we'll wait to see what happens.

For what regards OSG we're still in the process of modifying stuff so we need more time.
But thank you very much for indicating the way to proceed.

I'm at your disposal for any question.
Best regards,
Cheers!
  Fabrizio
