<PRE>Hi,

So the first &quot;stable&quot; version of the Oculus SDK have been publicly released. I am happy to report that I got the OpenSceneGraph integration up and running. Although there is a bit more work to get it completely stable. 

Oculus have now launched what they call Oculus Home, which is their portal for pretty much everything. To play nice with this portal you have to handle your application with special care, or as Oculus calls it &quot;VR Focus Management&quot;. This means that your application must handle situations such as the user unplugging the HMD, handling application shutdown and restart in a special way, etc.. 

This have not been implemented yet, the main part being the application shutdown problems. This is mainly due to differences between the way Oculus prefer you to handle shutdown and how shutdown is performed from OSG. So shutting down the application currently results in a crash on my machine. But hopefully this is something we should be able to fix.

As usual have the previous development been branched to:
