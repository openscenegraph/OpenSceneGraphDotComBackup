<PRE>Hi Chris,

I tried most of examples. Now I'm focusing on glsl_simple.osgt as it looks simple, but only the second row of shapes shows. If I modify the vertex shader a little, I get to see both first/second row.

I've received some OSG model (file.osg) from someone, and I was able to run it on the desktop (OpenGL). I was told the OSG model runs on OpenGLES2.0. For me to run it on OpenGLES2, I added the precision qualifiers to build, but the result still doesn't look correct. I'm not sure if more / what modification is needed. For example, I modified the OSG shader generator, but it didn't help. Does OSG layers completely abstract underlying APIs (OpenGL, OpenGLES,,,), meaning the OSG models are API independent? or does each OSG model have some API specific code? For example, I don't see any precision qualifiers in OSG examples, and does that mean those models are not for OpenGLES2.0?

I'm trying to figure out where the issue comes from: OSG model, OSG layers, OpenGLES library.

Thanks,
-hyun

OGL ES requires a shader.&#8203;

Many of the OSG-Data models don't have shaders built into them, and will not transform and rasterize as a result.

Which OSG model did you try that had most surfaces transparent?
