<PRE>I figured out a solution:
* Subclass the attribute in question. Make the subclass' apply do nothing.
* Apply the subclassed attribute to the root of the scene graph's stateset 
- this protects against the State instance encountering the unmodified 
attribute first, so cloneType-ing that, making the global default attribute 
not get applied repeatedly, and not have any OpenGL calls if it does.
* Apply the subclassed attribute anywhere that doesn't care.
* Apply the regular attribute anywhere that *does* care, including places 
that needed the regular default state.

Hopefully, this relatively simple solution shows up for anyone searching 
for this in the future.

Cheers,

Chris

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far, the best thing I've got is default-constructing the particular

</I>&gt;<i> the number of unnecessary GL calls I was getting before I tried this.

</I>&gt;<i> A solution that I think would work would be 
</I>&gt;<i> calling getGlobalDefaultAttribute on the State object as then the pointers

</I>&gt;<i> any clean way of getting the State instance to my visitor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, there'd be some neat trick I've missed that lets me say &quot;any 
</I>&gt;<i> subgraph of this node doesn't care about this attribute type, so set the 
</I>&gt;<i> default/leave whatever's there from the last draw call&quot; that would work 
</I>&gt;<i> with the normal state composition mechanisms so I could override it from a 
</I>&gt;<i> parent stateset or make it protected so it couldn't be overridden by parent 
</I>&gt;<i> statesets. Maybe a custom StateAttribute could do that, but maybe someone 
</I>&gt;<i> on this mailing list knows something I don't already.
