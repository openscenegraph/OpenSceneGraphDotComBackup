<PRE>I think I solved my own problem. I was planning to use

viewer.addSlave(cam,...)


and then use

cam-&gt;setReferenceFrame(osg::Transform::ABSOLUTE_RF)


to decouple the slave camera from the master. (If this is not the best
approach, I would still like to hear, but it seems pretty clean)

It turned out that I did not even need the second call. I think this is
because I have an update callback attached to each of the slave cameras
that explicitly sets the view matrix to match the world-to-local matrix of
some node in the scenegraph and thereby overrides the slaving.

By the way, this is something else that has bothered me. The requirement
for a camera to track a node in the scenegraph seems like it should be
extremely common. But in order to implement this I had to write my own
little NodeTracker Callback as follows:

class NodeTracker : public NodeCallback

{

public:

   NodePath _nodepath;


   NodeTracker(Node* node):_nodepath(node-&gt;getParentalNodePaths()[0]){}


   virtual void operator()(Node* node, NodeVisitor* nv)

   {

 ref_ptr&lt;Camera&gt; cam=node-&gt;asCamera();

 if(cam)

 {

 Matrix mat2=cam-&gt;getViewMatrix();

 Matrix mat=computeWorldToLocal(_nodepath);

cam-&gt;setViewMatrix(mat);

 }

 traverse(node, nv);

   }

};

It feels like this is such a common requirement that something like it
should be built into OSG. I had a look at the tutorial on the subject :

<A HREF="http://trac.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg//wiki/Support/Tutorials/CameraControlNodeFollowing">http://trac.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg//wiki/Support/Tutorials/CameraControlNodeFollowing</A>

but it recommends a solution that seems even more generally useful and is
quite verbose, yet is not included in osg. What am I missing here?

&gt;<i> Hi all

</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to render a single scene from multiple viewpoints. I initially

</I>&gt;<i> their own GraphicsContext, but even though the windows corresponding to
</I>&gt;<i> these GraphicsContexts get created, it appears as if all rendering is done
</I>&gt;<i> in a single window with multiple viewpoints being rendered over one another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously there are many ways to skin this cat, but I would appreciate
</I>&gt;<i> some guidance on the recommended approach. To recap my requirements are :
</I>&gt;<i>  - Multiple cameras viewing the same scene.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Camera positions and orientations must be independently controlled.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Node update callbacks should be called only once per Node per render
</I>&gt;<i> cycle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any help will be appreciated
