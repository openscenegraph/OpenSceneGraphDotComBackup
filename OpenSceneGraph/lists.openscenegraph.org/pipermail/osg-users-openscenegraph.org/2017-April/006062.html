<PRE>Thanks Riccardo and Robert for your inputs.

Robert, yes you are correct that the only issue I had with the
CompositeViewer was that the same Node's callback would get called as many
times as views that it appeared in. This means that for example if I have a
simple update that would translate a node a fixed amount, then nodes that
appear in mulitple views would move faster than those that appear in a
single view only. Also, as I add more cameras nodes end up moving faster.

Obviously I can fix this in the update callback itself, by checking
something like simulationTime (and I would ultimately have to do this
anyway to make my motion happen at the same speed, irrespective of frame
rate), but I would prefer to not have the callbacks called at all when not
required.

Incidentally, I found that the (non-composite) viewer did not immediately
solve this. It would only go away if all my cameras shared the exact same
root node. Now I have some symbology that I wish to display on one camera,
but not the others, but I managed to achieve this by setting the nodemask
appropriately.

I am not really doing anything fancy with the callbacks. I created a class
which extends osg::Callback and overrode the run method to update a
MatrixTransform node (via getMatrix and setMatrix). I then created another
class which extends MatrixTransform and in the constructor I call

this-&gt;setUpdateCallback

providing an instance of my callback class as the argument. Now whenever I
add an instance of my MatrixTransform class to the scenegraph, it
implements the motion I want.

This seems to work, except for the multiple update problem.

Hannes

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am trying to render a single scene from multiple viewpoints. I
</I>&gt;<i> initially
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented this with a compositeviewer as per the osgthirdpersonview
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example. This worked fine except that my update callbacks appeared to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting called more than once per render cycle. I assumed that the update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; traversal was being done for each view separately and therefore nodes
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are present in multiple views will have their update callbacks called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple times. So, at this point I tried to do the same thing but with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; single View, somewhat similar to the osgCamera example. But, I do not
</I>&gt;<i> want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to add my cameras with viewer.addSlave as I want them to move
</I>&gt;<i> independently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of one another. So I tried adding them into the scene graph and giving
</I>&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their own GraphicsContext, but even though the windows corresponding to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these GraphicsContexts get created, it appears as if all rendering is
</I>&gt;<i> done
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a single window with multiple viewpoints being rendered over one
</I>&gt;<i> another.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Obviously there are many ways to skin this cat, but I would appreciate
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guidance on the recommended approach. To recap my requirements are :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - Multiple cameras viewing the same scene.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - Camera positions and orientations must be independently controlled.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - Node update callbacks should be called only once per Node per render
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cycle.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any help will be appreciated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
