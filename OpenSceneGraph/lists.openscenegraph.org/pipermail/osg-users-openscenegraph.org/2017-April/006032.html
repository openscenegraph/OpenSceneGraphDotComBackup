<PRE>Hi KOS,

On 5 April 2017 at 15:41, Konstantin &lt;<A HREF="../../../listinfo.cgi/osg-users-openscenegraph.html">lalakostya at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> First... Thanks :)

</I>
Thanks for the testing.

&gt;<i> BUT.....
</I>&gt;<i> I have application based on OpenSceneGraph 3.4.0 (built with GL3 profile)
</I>&gt;<i> and it works well on Mac (in OpenGL 2.1 compatibility context)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I've switched to 3.5.6 (GL3 core) I have multiple problems:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (*) Multiple VAO errors in console (OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL=DEBUG_FP) when
</I>&gt;<i> ShaderComposition is ON (like vao not binded, so Program compilation was
</I>&gt;<i> failed).
</I>
I would have thought VAO and glProgram would be orthogonal.
Unfortunately I don't have OSX access so can't test things out myself,
so have to rely on OSX users to test and provide guidance.

Could you post the errors?  Is possible to reproduce the error with OSG example?

As a general note, osg::ShapeComposition is deprecated, #pragmat(tic)
shader composition and upcoming extensions to it are the way forward
for OSG applications so I'd recommend looking in migrating over to the
new shader functionality.  If you have any questions then I'd suggest
starting up another thread.

&gt;<i> (*) Strange things with lighting: Don't know how to explain it now, but like
</I>&gt;<i> something was changed in the osgUtil::PositionalStateContainer.
</I>
I just checked with git log on the PositionStateContainer header and
source files and nothing other than typo fixes has been changed with
them in 5 years.  So if there is a change in behaviour it will be
coming from elsewhere.

Can you reproduce the problem with any of the OSG examples?


&gt;<i> (*) Problems with osgAnimation::RigGeometry (I think because of VAO)
</I>
Again can you reproduce this with any of the OSG examples?


&gt;<i> (*) osgText::Text3D setCharacterSize  don't change geometry in dynamic (I've
</I>&gt;<i> added handler to osgtext3d example, changed text3d node's DataVariance to
</I>&gt;<i> DYNAMIC and test some functions)
</I>
Could you post these changes to osgtext3d so I can see the problem,
hopefully it'll appear under linux and I'll be able to investigate.

&gt;<i> PS
</I>&gt;<i> ShaderHint=SHADER_NONE in DisplaySettings
</I>&gt;<i> My ShaderComposer can create version #150
</I>
The shaders version numbers used for GL3 fallback shaders were chosen
by a fellow OSX/GL3 core profile user, is it safe/preferable to got
for GLSL version #150?  If we need to adapt the shaders in some way
I'm happy to consider changes - the more widely the shaders the work
the better.

--

For all these issues, I'd like to resolve them, but am hampered by not
having an OSX system.  This means we'll need help from OSX users to
both provide clear tests that reproduce the issues and then for us as
a group to work out solutions, code them up and then do another round
of testing.

Cheers,
Robert
