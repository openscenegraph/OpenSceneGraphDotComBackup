<PRE>Thanks tor the test program. I've got it compile on my Linux system with 
just removing the Windows headers you added, why were these added?

I can confirm the problem, I can pick the cessna without the AutoTransform 
by zooming in but not the one under the AutoTransform.  I haven't yet had a 
chance to look into why this happening.  I'm really busy with other work 
right now so can't look into this right away.   If you want to look into it 
yourself I'd recommend stepping through how the 
osgUtil::IntersectionTraversal is handling the AutoTransform.  It'll be a 
bit non standard as the AutoTransform is view dependent, which the 
IntersectionTraversal isn't view dependent so there is potential for the 
two different traversals have differing solutions.  In your usage case your 
wanting it to behave like IntersectiinTraversal assumes the same matrix 
that that was computed for the rendering, however, this isn't the general 
case, intersections can potentially can happen for any direction, or any 
one of multiple views.
