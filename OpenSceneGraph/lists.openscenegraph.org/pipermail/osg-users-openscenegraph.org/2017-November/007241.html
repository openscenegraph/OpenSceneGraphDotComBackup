<PRE>Hi Robert,

Yes, the model is ineffective in the sense that it has 150 000 separate 
triangles on the same level in the scene graph, that's the nature of 
basic usage of OpenFlight and I guess that's why the plugin applies an 
optimization of its own. But this could be optimized and merged much 
faster before and I'm just looking for a way to get it to behave like 
that again, to keep my software from being slower in a new version.

Some results from VTune, where I have manually filtered and presented 
the top two culprits in 3.5.1 compared to 3.5.8 (where I gave up after 2 
minutes):

3.5.8: TOTAL: 121.4s

  * Registry::read -&gt; Optimizer::optimize -&gt;
    MergeGeometryVisitor::mergeGroup -&gt; Group::removeChildren -&gt;
    OpenThreads::Atomic::operator++ (78.5s)
  * Registry::read -&gt; Optimizer::optimize -&gt;
    MergeGeometryVisitor::mergeGroup -&gt; Group::removeChildren -&gt;
    OpenThreads::Atomic::operator-- (27.4s)

3.5.1: TOTAL: 12.7s

  * Registry::read -&gt; Optimizer::optimize -&gt;
    Optimizer::StateVisitor::optimize -&gt; Node::setStateSet -&gt;
    StateSet::~StateSet -&gt; StateSet::clear -&gt;
    StateAttribute::removeParent (2.4s)
  * Registry::read -&gt; Optimizer::optimize -&gt;
    Optimizer::MergeGeodesVisitor::mergeGeodes -&gt; Node::~Node -&gt;
    Node::setStateSet -&gt; StateAttribute::removeParent (2.2s)

The MergeGeometryVisitor was applied in 3.5.1 as well but didn't take 
more than about 0.06s. I guess the 3.5.1 results are generally less 
interesting but at least they show that MergeGeometryVisitor was not a 
problem there.

I don't know if this gives you some ideas directly or if we need to keep 
digging. I will have another look shortly either way, but of course 
hoping for you or someone else to come up with some bright ideas to 
shorten the time to fixing this problem.

Regards,
Andreas
