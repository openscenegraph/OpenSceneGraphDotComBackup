<PRE>Hi All,

Today I merged the osganimation branch that Julien Valentin has been
working on.  If you have questions about the specifics of these
changes then I'll let Julien provide answers.

With any major set of changes being merged there is always the chance
of build errors on platform combinations that we haven't tested yet,
so if you see an issue let us know and we'll try and resolve it as
soon as we can.

There is also chances of build breaks in end user applications as
there are a few API changes to osgAnimation.  My hope that most users
won't find issues and it should be just a case of rebuilding your
application against master.

My plan is to tag the 3.5.8 developer release early next week, so
getting some testing of master across a range of platforms will help
with this.

Thanks for you help with testing, and thanks to Julien for his efforts
on improving osgAnimation.
Robert.
</PRE>
