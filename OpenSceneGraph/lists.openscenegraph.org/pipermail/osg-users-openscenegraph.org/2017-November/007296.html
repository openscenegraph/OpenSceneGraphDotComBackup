<PRE>Thanks Robert! Works fine here as well, and I think the line of least 
resistance was the right way this time.

Any plans on a 3.5.9 release soon? I'm now facing the problem of either 
waiting until the next release, or basing my software on 3.5.8 with this 
modification and thus implicitly recommending users to use 3.5.8 to be 
compatible but with the implication that their OpenFlight models might 
be load slowly...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I can't really say if it's good or bad, but the Optimizer should of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> course handle bad data in the best way possible.
</I>&gt;<i> No need to argue whether it's awful or not, there isn't any debate

</I>&gt;<i> stored in the worst possible way for memory utilization and
</I>&gt;<i> performance
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use of the osgUtil::Optimizer is a very crude fix for bad databases.
</I>&gt;<i> It's far better to just create a scene graph in an efficient form
</I>&gt;<i> right from the start.  Optimizing bad databases at best leads to
</I>&gt;<i> fragment memory, it really is just papering over cracks and is
</I>&gt;<i> unlikely to ever produce optimal databases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The main issue for me though, is that OSG handles this dataset in a much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slower way than before, hence my re-introduction of the previous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> optimization. But you're completely right, and I realize now, that other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nodes than drawables aren't handle correctly. I haven't gotten used to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drawables being nodes yet...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the fact that the OpenFlight plugin creates a non-optimal scene graph and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then uses the Optimizer itself to fix this is probably a separate and larger
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem - if it indeed is a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, big topic.  I'm familiar with the problems that the OpenFlight
</I>&gt;<i> loader generates, but less so with Creator or other tools that
</I>&gt;<i> generate the content.  I'd much rather the OpenFlight loader builds
</I>&gt;<i> more efficient database to start with rather than rely upon the
</I>&gt;<i> Optimizer to fix problems once the data is loaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I believe it's necessary to at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least get MergeGeometryVisitor to behave as fast as before, either by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modifying my fixes or by rewriting parts of it. I hope you will find the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time to decide on this soon, and please let me know if I can help!
</I>&gt;<i> The fix I have checked in master:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With performance testing of just the merge geometry on your house
</I>&gt;<i> dataset I saw a 70sec merge geometry before, and 0.1 sec merge after
</I>&gt;<i> my changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've got plenty of other stuff to get on with so I'll assume this
