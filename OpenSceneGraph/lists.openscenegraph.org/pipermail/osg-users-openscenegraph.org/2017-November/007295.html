<PRE>Hi Andreas,

I have checked in a refactor of MergeGeometry visitor that makes it
work properly with groups containing any type of nodes, and avoids the
O(N^2) removChild() usage.  In the end I took the line of least
resistance and just used the approach of removing all children and
adding back the ndoes.

No need to argue whether it's awful or not, there isn't any debate
when it comes to real-time performance : this particular database is
stored in the worst possible way for memory utilization and
performance

Use of the osgUtil::Optimizer is a very crude fix for bad databases.
It's far better to just create a scene graph in an efficient form
right from the start.  Optimizing bad databases at best leads to
fragment memory, it really is just papering over cracks and is
unlikely to ever produce optimal databases.


&gt;<i> The main issue for me though, is that OSG handles this dataset in a much
</I>&gt;<i> slower way than before, hence my re-introduction of the previous
</I>&gt;<i> optimization. But you're completely right, and I realize now, that other
</I>&gt;<i> nodes than drawables aren't handle correctly. I haven't gotten used to
</I>&gt;<i> drawables being nodes yet...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the fact that the OpenFlight plugin creates a non-optimal scene graph and
</I>&gt;<i> then uses the Optimizer itself to fix this is probably a separate and larger
</I>&gt;<i> problem - if it indeed is a problem.
</I>
Yep, big topic.  I'm familiar with the problems that the OpenFlight
loader generates, but less so with Creator or other tools that
generate the content.  I'd much rather the OpenFlight loader builds
more efficient database to start with rather than rely upon the
Optimizer to fix problems once the data is loaded.

&gt;<i> But I believe it's necessary to at
</I>&gt;<i> least get MergeGeometryVisitor to behave as fast as before, either by
</I>&gt;<i> modifying my fixes or by rewriting parts of it. I hope you will find the
</I>&gt;<i> time to decide on this soon, and please let me know if I can help!
</I>
The fix I have checked in master:

    <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/commit/bc4a9d9dd0158e1e99d0ca1d1d95ef204220a560">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/commit/bc4a9d9dd0158e1e99d0ca1d1d95ef204220a560</A>

With performance testing of just the merge geometry on your house
dataset I saw a 70sec merge geometry before, and 0.1 sec merge after
my changes.

I've got plenty of other stuff to get on with so I'll assume this
issue is now resolved.

Cheers,
Robert.
