<PRE>Hi All,

This afternoon I tagged the 3.5.8 developer release:

   <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.5.8">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.5.8</A>

This dev release wraps up recent improvements to osgText and
osgAnimation as well as range of other build and bug fixes.

This dev release also contains fixes to outstanding issues picked up
by CoverityScan - we now have a defect density of 0.00 per 1000 lines
according to Coverity's webpage for the OpenSceneGraph.   Coverity can
only pick up certain types of bugs it's really not like the OSG is now
completely free of bugs... but as far as we can take this tool for
improving quality we have done so now and should be easy to keep on
top of going forward.

Thanks to all those that have contributed to the OSG in this dev cycle.

Cheers,
Robert.

attached fixes for configuring and building the osgPlugin exr with
Visual Studio and using out-of-the-box builds of ilmbase and openexr,
i.e. without manual/extra config for using these 2 libs with the
OSG.Previously, the assumption was made that ilmbase and openexr were
installed in a common directory and hence the header files and libs
were both found in that common directory. That is not consistent with
other libs and this submission makes it consistent and therefore the
OSG configures out of the box. I made this work for
ilmbase-2.1.0.tar.gz / openexr-2.1.0.tar.gz and ilmbase-2.2.0.tar.gz /
openexr-2.2.0.tar.gz

Attached is a fix in GLExtension, which is based on latest git
version, that fixes the usage of uniform buffer objects on macOS.
Under macOS core OpenGL features aren't exported as extension. OpenGL
3.1 includes the GL_ARB_uniform_buffer_object as core feature for
example. On macOS a simple osg::isGLExtensionSupported() call would
fail. It is required to use the isGLExtensionOrVersionSupported()
method. This is what my fix does.

I have implemented readObject to make loading objects from SceneLoader
in the LWS plugin work. I'm not sure about other implications from
changes leading up to this problem (readRefFile instead of
readNodeFile in SceneLoader) but this fix works for me.
