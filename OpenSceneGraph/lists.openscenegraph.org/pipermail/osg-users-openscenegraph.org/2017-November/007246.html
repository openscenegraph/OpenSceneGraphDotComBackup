<PRE>Hi Bj&#246;rn,

Thanks for your efforts on the tutorials.  I had a quick look at what
you have done so far, but am not yet clear how you are thinking it
might evolve.  I noticed both .md and .html files, are both something
that will be maintained?

&gt;<i> * Is this a tutorial format worth pursuing?
</I>
I quite like the idea of using github for tutorials, as it can easily
be placed alongside the main OpenSceneGrpah repository and maintained
in a pretty straight forward way. The format I don't yet have an
strong opinions on though.  Feedback from new members to the community
who are currently learning would probably be really useful.

&gt;<i> * Is Markdeep the right choice?
</I>
Possibly.

&gt;<i> * Is CCBY and MIT licenses that should be used for this project?
</I>
For a tutorial I think it would be useful having a license that allows
users to just grab source code and insert it directly into their
applications without having to worry about attribution/including
licensing.  Would this be public domain?  I'm not 100% sure.

The documentation parts would naturally fall under creative commons.

&gt;<i> * What C++ standard should the source code be written in (my suggestion is C++98 for maximum compatibility)?
</I>
Unless one is demonstrating use with later versions of C++ I think it
would be appropriate to leave it with CMake defaults like the OSG does
at present.

There is real value in having some C++11 and later tutorials as well.

Robert.
