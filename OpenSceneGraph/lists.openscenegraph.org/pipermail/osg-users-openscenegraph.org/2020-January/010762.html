<PRE>I converted it to ascii using MeshLab

Yes, using another format is probably a better idea. Do you know which 
format is typically used that supports binary encoding?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So this has to be interpreted as uv coordinates like (U0, V0, U1 V1, ..., 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Un Vn), as there are 3 vertices, there will be three times two (u+v) == six

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> end_header
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I converted the binary ply to ascii ply and there is one line of a vertex:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -7.326906 -0.92065 -15.26979 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So x y z totally makes sense.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is the line of a face:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *3* 74350 89839 97021 *6* 0.670419 0.990827 0.669870 0.993111 0.668217 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0.991639 255 255 255 255
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the explanation in the header makes sense.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's makes partial sense... each far having 6 additional floats and a red, 
</I>&gt;<i> green, blue, alpha colour.  How one is supposed to interpret those 6 floats 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be left to the implementation to infer that it means each vertex 
</I>&gt;<i> has a Vec2(u,v) value for it, that's an inference based on this particular 
</I>&gt;<i> dataset, there doesn't look to be an formal mapping.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The design of the format looks like each face could have any number of 
</I>&gt;<i> floats in the list, so one face could legally have 0 additional floats, 
</I>&gt;<i> while the next could have 10, then the next 1 and so for.  To parse the 
</I>&gt;<i> texcoord as a Vec2(u,v) one would have to make sure that there are 6 
</I>&gt;<i> floats, and also since the OSG binds the vertex, normal and texcoords 
</I>&gt;<i> arrays as BIND_PER_VERTEX one would need to duplicate the vertex and 
</I>&gt;<i> normals to match the per corner texcoords.   
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then after generating all the geometry one would probably be best to run a 
</I>&gt;<i> mesh optimizer to remove all the duplicate vertices/normal/texcoord pairs 
</I>&gt;<i> and reset all the triangle indices.  To not due this optimization pass 
</I>&gt;<i> would likely lead to massively larger and inefficient geometries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's all possible but does all require a bit of work and inference that 
</I>&gt;<i> that's how the data is intended to be used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This all tells me that PLY might be used in some sectors but it really 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't a good format for doing so, it likely would be far better to use a 
</I>&gt;<i> more standardized format that doesn't have implicit mappings that you have 
</I>&gt;<i> to infer based on the data that some 3rd party tools have chosen to pump 
</I>&gt;<i> out.
