<PRE>Robert, thank you for the reply.  The community-crickets were a little 
disconcerting.

I don't think it has to be as complicated as you described.  Simply finding 
the height at the location of the object, placing it there, and placing a 
file reference within that tile's hierarchy so that the model file is paged 
in (or not if it's already in the cache).  Do this for every tile in the 
hierarchy and you are done.  That would be a major jump in capability, at 
this point.

Either way, I'm simply looking to do the above and wondering if it appears 
feasible with current capabilities.

Best,
Brad
