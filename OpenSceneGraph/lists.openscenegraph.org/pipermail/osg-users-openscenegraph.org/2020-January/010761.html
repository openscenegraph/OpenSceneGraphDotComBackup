Did you regenerate the scene, the .ply you shared earlier is a binary.  
ascii is easier to infer what is going on so the dev/debugging stage using 
ascii makes sense, then once it's working try the binary.

It's makes partial sense... each far having 6 additional floats and a red, 
green, blue, alpha colour.  How one is supposed to interpret those 6 floats 
seems to be left to the implementation to infer that it means each vertex 
has a Vec2(u,v) value for it, that's an inference based on this particular 
dataset, there doesn't look to be an formal mapping.

The design of the format looks like each face could have any number of 
floats in the list, so one face could legally have 0 additional floats, 
while the next could have 10, then the next 1 and so for.  To parse the 
texcoord as a Vec2(u,v) one would have to make sure that there are 6 
floats, and also since the OSG binds the vertex, normal and texcoords 
arrays as BIND_PER_VERTEX one would need to duplicate the vertex and 
normals to match the per corner texcoords.   

Then after generating all the geometry one would probably be best to run a 
mesh optimizer to remove all the duplicate vertices/normal/texcoord pairs 
and reset all the triangle indices.  To not due this optimization pass 
would likely lead to massively larger and inefficient geometries.

It's all possible but does all require a bit of work and inference that 
that's how the data is intended to be used.

This all tells me that PLY might be used in some sectors but it really 
isn't a good format for doing so, it likely would be far better to use a 
more standardized format that doesn't have implicit mappings that you have 
to infer based on the data that some 3rd party tools have chosen to pump 
out.
