<PRE>
The osgUI NodeKit was written to be used from C++ and/or Lua script.  
During development the primary focus was on making sure it was functional 
via Lua script and as part of Present3D presentations (see 
OpenSceneGraph/applicaton/present3D).

Due to the focus on Lua script usage I didn't write any C++ examples, 
instead it was all done via Lua scripts.  There a couple of Lua scripts in 
the OpenSceneGraph-Data/ui directory that illustrate it in action.  For 
example try:

     osgviewer ~/Data/OpenSceneGraph-Data/ui/TabWidget.lua.90,0,0.rot 

Note the 90,0.0.rot uses a psuedo plugin to rotate the widget that is on 
the XY plane by default to the XZ plane to fit with the OSG default viewing 
orientation (X to the east/right, Y north/forward, Z up).

The project that funded this work, after the end of the project I haven't 
had time have time to further develop.
