Thanks.  For future reference this might be useful. At this point in time I 
don't feel confident about inferring the data usage as it could be so open 
ended.  Have you come across any formal specification that MeshLab are 
assuming for their export?  Perhaps ask them.
 

&gt;<i> Yes, using another format is probably a better idea. Do you know which 
</I>&gt;<i> format is typically used that supports binary encoding?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I can't answer this. The OSG is used in many different sectors with many 
different tools there isn't one binary file format that is used 
pervasively. Perhaps others in your sector might be able to advice.

Cheers,
Robert
