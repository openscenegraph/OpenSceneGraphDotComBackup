<PRE>Hi Chris,

I slowly closing in on the cause of the Font issue, currently it looks like
the removeView() is behaving differently form the CompositeViewer
destructor and not handling clean up of contexts correctly.  I need to
refactor how things are done internally, but expect to have a solution
checked in this afternoon.

This fix might remove the issue with the static initialization by cleaning
up Font GL objects before the viewers are entirely destroyed and prior to
static clean up.

Thanks for the tip.  I am not a gamer these days, way too many other things
competing with my time.  I also have enough dev work that I really don't
want to get sucked into another open source project, there really are too
many projects that use the OSG for me to start providing direct support for
these projects beyond what I can provide through the OSG forum/mailing
list.  Please remember there is one of me vs many OSG users/projects.

Cheers,
Robert.
