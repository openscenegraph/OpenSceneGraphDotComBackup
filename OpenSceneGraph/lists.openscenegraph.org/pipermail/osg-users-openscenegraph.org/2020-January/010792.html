<PRE>Hi Robert,

I'm reasonably sure that Fabian's crash isn't the same issue as that 
example exposes.


&gt;&gt;<i>    - Fabian has done something weird with either OSG or OpenMW that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    hasn't been specified yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the codebase is the same perhaps it comes down to a sensitivity to 
</I>&gt;<i> compiler version or dependencies?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We have official builds for a variety of Linux distros, Windows and MacOS 
(and semi-official builds for Android that are generally less reliable) so 
we should have pretty good coverage with known-good dependency and tooling 
versions. As I've mentioned before, the most likely culprit for this 
suddenly appearing for Fabian is that we pretty much never link to OSG 
statically. It's a nightmare on Windows (I don't think anyone's even 
attempted it in the last five years) but is more feasible on Linux, where 
the majority of our contributors are, so I've put out a call for other 
testers to try and reproduce the problem.



Also, Robert, I'm assuming you don't have a copy of Morrowind to test 
OpenMW with. Right now, Steam, GreenManGaming and Fanatical are all 
offering it for less than &#163;4, but at least one of those sales ends in less 
than twenty hours. If you're not keen, &#163;4 is a reasonable investment for me 
to make to increase cooperation between our projects, but it would help if 
you got back to me quickly.

Thanks,

Chris

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - It's beginning to feel like you're misspelling OpenMW deliberately.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sigh.  I likely have dyslexia, while I've never been formally diagnosed I 
</I>&gt;<i> have the traits, the downside is that I regularily get letters wrong, don't 
</I>&gt;<i> spot mispellings.  This isn't personal, it's just an issue I have to deal 
</I>&gt;<i> with, and unfortunately as I read/wrote code and read/write email the 
</I>&gt;<i> community also have to accept that I don't get everything right every 
</I>&gt;<i> time.  In other ways my brain functions pretty well so overall I can still 
</I>&gt;<i> be productive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Regarding the as-yet unresolved default font/object cache not being 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    released issue I reported in March, the ball was left in your court with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    nothing more I could do. Hopefully enough has been linked above that we can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    move forward with that again if you've got more time now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is the one that the attached example recreates then I will be 
</I>&gt;<i> looking into this today.
