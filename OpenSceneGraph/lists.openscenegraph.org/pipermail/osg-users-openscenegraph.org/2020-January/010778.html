<PRE>Hi Robert,

As I've mentioned in the past, I'm an OpenMW (note the single M) developer. 
It was actually me who reported the issues with the default font, and only 
a subset were resolved before you went on hiatus. I've lost the thread 
where we were discussing it as I'd bookmarked the forum thread, which is 
now dead. As I recall, though, my most recent minimal 
things-don't-get-relased-when-they-should example was resolvable by a 
couple of potential changes I suggested, but you said they'd have to wait 
until you could investigate more thoroughly, as it was in code no one had 
touched for a while, so could maybe upset other applications, or not 
exhaustively remove all such bugs.

I pretty much stopped trying to make OpenMW play nicely with 3.6.x when you 
disappeared as there wasn't much point if nothing would be mergeable until 
you had more time, and now you do, I don't have much.

Anyway, on to the matter at hand, I don't get the crash, but I'm missing 
some commits in the 3.6 branch, and also I still have one of my proposed 
fixes. I'm making things more upstream-like, and I'll add another sentence 
once everything's rebuilt.

So after waiting an age for everything to rebuild, I got reminded that the 
occlusion query API got changed by Julien Valentine's recent PR. He made a 
PR for OpenMW that was supposed to resolve that, but obviously it didn't 
work until I tweaked it. Once I'd built everything, I tested it, and I'm 
not seeing the crash here. This is with a Debug build of OpenMW and OSG, 
and on Windows, and I don't think anyone else is using debug builds of 
both, especially not on Windows.

I guess that means that I've not really given any more information beyond 
this not being something that happens for everyone. It might be dependent 
on other factors, so a more detailed description of how reliable the crash 
is and whether it's dependent on anything is needed before anyone can do 
anything on OpenMW's end.



One thing of note is that the OpenMW profiler doesn't use the default font 
(at least on my machine). It uses a truetype one. I seem to remember seeing 
it use the default font in the past, and it's not impossible that this is 
toggled via a setting I've forgotten about, but I've had a good look and 
can't find one.

So that's what I know.

Chris

</I>&gt;<i> One possible cause of crash like this is memory corruption during the run

</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps others might have seen something similar and can help shed some
