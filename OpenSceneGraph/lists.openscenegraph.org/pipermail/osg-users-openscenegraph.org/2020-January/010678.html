<PRE>Hi,

osg::Material pretty much encapsulates OpenGL's fixed-function material 
state, so things like glMaterialfv (that controls material settings for 
whole draw calls) and glColorMaterial (that controls what vertex colours 
actually affect). If you're using a suitably old GLSL version, you can 
access this state through the built-in uniforms. These aren't featured 
prominently in lots of the modern OpenGL documentation like the wiki as 
they're removed in modern OpenGL, but I have this bookmarked and it at 
least says what's there: <A HREF="http://mew.cx/glsl_quickref.pdf.">http://mew.cx/glsl_quickref.pdf.</A> Once you know an 
actual uniform name, relevant stuff should show up in a search engine. The 
one problem you'll hit is that there's no built-in uniform to say whether 
glColorMaterial is enabled or what mode it's in, so you'll have to set that 
up yourself with a uniform or shader define.

I *think* that with the right combination of settings, OSG exposes similar 
uniforms in newer OpenGL/GLSL versions where the fixed function pipeline 
has been removed, so that's something to look into. I've never needed this, 
though, so don't know if it just happens when OSG is compiled with GL3 
support, or whether there's more that you need to do.

Hope this helps,

Chris
