<PRE>Hi Chris,

Thanks the links.  I've tracked down the example you created and re-run it
on my system and on the scene graph creation of the second window/view I
get text without textures.

In summary:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Fabian has done something weird with either OSG or OpenMW that
</I>&gt;<i>    hasn't been specified yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the codebase is the same perhaps it comes down to a sensitivity to
</I>compiler version or dependencies?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - It's beginning to feel like you're misspelling OpenMW deliberately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sigh.  I likely have dyslexia, while I've never been formally diagnosed I
</I>have the traits, the downside is that I regularily get letters wrong, don't
spot mispellings.  This isn't personal, it's just an issue I have to deal
with, and unfortunately as I read/wrote code and read/write email the
community also have to accept that I don't get everything right every
time.  In other ways my brain functions pretty well so overall I can still
be productive.


&gt;<i>    - Regarding the as-yet unresolved default font/object cache not being
</I>&gt;<i>    released issue I reported in March, the ball was left in your court with
</I>&gt;<i>    nothing more I could do. Hopefully enough has been linked above that we can
</I>&gt;<i>    move forward with that again if you've got more time now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If this is the one that the attached example recreates then I will be
looking into this today.
