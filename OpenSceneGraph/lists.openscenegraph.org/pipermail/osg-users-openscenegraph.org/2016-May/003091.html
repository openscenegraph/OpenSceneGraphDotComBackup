I have submitted my pull request again (it was the gitignore patterns for Visual Studio).

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

I agree that doing merges online using the GitHub platform is a very bad idea, except for trivial changes (for example changing a spelling error inside a readme file).

For all cases with source code I will fetch the pull request to my local machine and do the merge to my workspace. Then I can use my favorite diff tool as well as compile and test. If all my tests pass then I commit the merge to the master branch and push the changes to the online repo.

(The above workflow is pretty much identical to: applying a patch file -&gt; test&amp;compile -&gt; commit to SVN.)
