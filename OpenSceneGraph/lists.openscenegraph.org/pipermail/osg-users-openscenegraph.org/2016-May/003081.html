<PRE>Hi Jannik,

Thanks for the info.  Looks like my fix of the author name/email
address yesterday created all these problems with pull requests.

I've developed rather a love/hate relationship with git and github.
Some things going really smoothly but then can turn around and bite
you and just throw lots of road blocks in you way, constraining you to
work with certain path or break things.  So far git has created far
more work for me than it's saved.

I find it a bit depressing that there is still so much more to learn
about git and github before I can safely master it.  Personally I'd
rather just get on code, fix problems with the OSG itself rather
jumping through hoops to use tools that are &quot;supposed&quot; to help your
work.

For now I have 30 pull requests to fix in some fashion as they aren't
in anyway useful as things stand.  First step will be to get all those
who've made a pull request to fetch the new history then see what
happens on github.  Perhaps it'll automatically fix things, perhaps
the author will have to resubmit.

Do you know what steps do members of the community need to do to fix
things?  Perhaps we can pass instructions on via comments of each pull
request.

Submitted code to osg-submissions might not be perfect but it's been a
hell of lot more reliable and robust than github.

Robert.

&gt;<i> Hi Robert,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> by fixing the author names you have essentially re-written the repository history. This means that everyone who submitted pull-requests in the past will have to manually rebase their changes on top of the new history. But it's not so difficult to do that if you know how to use the git rebase tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The github document &quot;Changing author info&quot; (which I assume you were looking at?) does state this caveat:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Note: Running this script rewrites history for all repository collaborators. After completing these steps, any person with forks or clones must fetch the rewritten history and rebase any local changes into the rewritten history.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the future you may want to avoid rewriting history (i.e. anything that requires a force-push) since it does cause disruption for people that have already sent in changes. But it's not a big deal now since github is not even the official submission route yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for checking out the changes in pull requests that were not adapted, you can look at the author's repository (e.g. <A HREF="https://github.com/vivijind/OpenSceneGraph/commits/master">https://github.com/vivijind/OpenSceneGraph/commits/master</A> shows the commits for PR <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/68">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/68</A>). In some cases it looks like the authors have deleted their repository, but you can still check out the pull request locally ( <A HREF="https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/">https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/</A> ) and from there look at the included commits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Jannik
