<PRE>Hi All,

I'm struggling to get git to work in a way that allows me to do a
proper review with the ability to graphically comparing sets of
changes, for instance I have a set one pull request that has 88 files
modified, alot of files but a small number of relatively minor changes
such a variable renames.  I've done a quick review online and spotted
that one instance so far where this renaming actually introduces a
bug.

I've experimented with pull in the 3rd party clone of the
openscenegraph that contains these modfications and successfully
created a patch and applying this to a local branch on my
openscenegraph, it applies fine but contains the known error, perhaps
others that I'll spot once I go through another full review.  This is
where graphically diff is crucial.  git makes it dead easy to merge
many file changes with a couple of lines of git on the command line,
but as yet I'm struggling to find a way to get git to allow me to
merge one file at a time and presented with a graphics diff that
allows me to individually accept/discard changes.

Will I need to write my own script to do this?   To do this I'd need
to get to spit out a list of all the modified files in a form that I
can pass into a script.

As things stand I am not prepared to merge a big patch with an unknown
number of bugs introduced simply because git makes it convenient to
merge as is and makes it hard to spot errors and intervene.

Thoughts, advice how to workaround these problems using git?

Robert.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Robert,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by fixing the author names you have essentially re-written the repository history. This means that everyone who submitted pull-requests in the past will have to manually rebase their changes on top of the new history. But it's not so difficult to do that if you know how to use the git rebase tool.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The github document &quot;Changing author info&quot; (which I assume you were looking at?) does state this caveat:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Note: Running this script rewrites history for all repository collaborators. After completing these steps, any person with forks or clones must fetch the rewritten history and rebase any local changes into the rewritten history.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the future you may want to avoid rewriting history (i.e. anything that requires a force-push) since it does cause disruption for people that have already sent in changes. But it's not a big deal now since github is not even the official submission route yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for checking out the changes in pull requests that were not adapted, you can look at the author's repository (e.g. <A HREF="https://github.com/vivijind/OpenSceneGraph/commits/master">https://github.com/vivijind/OpenSceneGraph/commits/master</A> shows the commits for PR <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/68">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/68</A>). In some cases it looks like the authors have deleted their repository, but you can still check out the pull request locally ( <A HREF="https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/">https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/</A> ) and from there look at the included commits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jannik
