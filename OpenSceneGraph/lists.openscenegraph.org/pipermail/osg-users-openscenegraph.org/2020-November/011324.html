If your application is running single threaded then adding/removing objects
from the scene graph should not be an issue.  It'll only be something to be
careful about when the application is multi-threaded.  The Qt aspect should
not have any bearing on the operation as long as race condition isn't
introduced.


&gt;<i> My idea is to send OSG USER events to complete the operation of adding and

Technically you could do it, I don't know why you think it's useful, it's
not something I know of others doing.  This is entirely something your
application will be doing, you can't ask use about how your code works or
doesn't work.

 Perhaps a far better thing to do would be to take a big step back and
rather aks about implementation details on a &quot;solution&quot; to a problem you've
dreamed up and only lives in your code, tell us about what you want your
application to do at a high level,  Perhaps then we can just tell you what
is normally done in this situation.
