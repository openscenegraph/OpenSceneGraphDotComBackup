It's up to your application to decide when your USER events are &quot;processed
completely&quot;, as what &quot;processed completely&quot; is completely meaningless to
the OSG itself.

It really feels like you are asking questions from the community when you
are the only one who can answer it.

You have access to the whole OSG code base.  You can build in debug, step
through every single line of code.  You have everything you need to figure
out what is going on.

We know NOTHING about your application, only *you* know about your
application and what you mean.  We aren't omnipotent. We can't see inside
your head, look over your shoulder to your code.

You will need to determine the answers from here.
