I did some work on signing avatars 10 to 20 years ago, in an academic
context. In fact, several of the first page of hits for the Google search
that Jan Ciger posted refer to that project (Virtual Humans at UEA).

My own role in that was to create software to turn signing transcriptions
written in an avatar-independent notation into animation data for driving
any humanoid avatar, in real time. Feel free to email me for more
information if this sounds relevant to what you have in mind. My
publications on this can be found through ResearchGate or Google Scholar.
As Jan says, there has been a large amount of work on this, by other
groups as well, although it seems to me that none of it has really taken
off. Perhaps because it is a very niche application. The demand would be
primarily from the pre-lingually deaf, i.e., those for whom signing is
their first language. With all respect to that population, it is a very
small one.

Personally, I would be more interested in extending my work to do
procedural animation of more general sorts of movement, but I've haven't
done anything substantial on that.
