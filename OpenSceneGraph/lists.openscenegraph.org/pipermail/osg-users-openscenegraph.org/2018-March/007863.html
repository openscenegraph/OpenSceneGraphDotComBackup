<PRE>Hi All,

I have just tagged the 3.5.10 developer release:

   <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.5.10">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.5.10</A>

Lots of refinements/fixes, but no major changes.  I'm pretty
comfortable with making a 3.6 branch from master as things stand.

One concern I do have with going for a stable release soon is getting
testing out in the community as I no longer get the same level of
release feedback from the community these days.  I don't have access
to all the platfroms and build combinations that the community does so
really need this, to know how well the current rev of the OSG is
working, without this I just have to do the testing I can and push
releases out and hope for the best.

Cheers,
Robert.

iOS CMake project generation improvements (bitcode option)when
building for iOS, Xcode allows developers to specify to enable or
disable the 'bitcode' compilation option. There's not a preferred way
to go and the choice is really up to the developer but considering
that:

1. Currently the generated project defaults the option to YES
2. There are almost 90 projects targets that should be modified if one
wants to disable the bitcode option (which considerably reduces the
footprint of the app)
3. Even though one can select all the 90+ targets and set the option
to NO for all of them, the updates could take a few seconds and could
be error prone because one could miss to select some targets

I propose to add a CMake setting that is displayed only when building
for iOS. By setting this option &quot;before&quot; the project generation would
speed up things for developers and would avoid errors at compiling
time.

&gt;<i>From Ravi Mathur, &quot;he freetype plugin currently forces the use of the
</I>first font within a truetype collection (.ttc index 0). I made a
slight modification such that users can specify any font index via the
userOptions input to osgText::readFontFile(). Specifically, the
freetype plugin now accepts a new string option of the format &quot;index=&lt;
unsigned int &gt;&quot;. Example usage:Code:
// Chooses the second font within the Menlo font collection
osg::ref_ptr&lt;osgDB::Options&gt; fontOptions = new osgDB::Options;
fontOptions-&gt;setObjectCacheHint(osgDB::Options::CACHE_OBJECTS);
fontOptions-&gt;setOptionString(&quot;index=1&quot;);
text-&gt;setFont(osgText::readFontFile(&quot;Menlo.ttc&quot;, fontOptions));

Applications declared DPI-aware in the Windows environmentApplications
that run on a Windows computer with desktop scaling enabled
gets scaled incorrectly since windows assumes that applications are
DPI-unaware unless declared otherwise.

This change declares the application DPI-aware, thus not automatically
scaled by the operating system.

The corresponding library call requires Windows 8.1 or later.


Thu, 30 Nov 2017 12:53:24 +0100
Author : Bj&#246;rn Blissing
Added script to identify Windows versionAdded script to identify the
Windows version used to compile the source.
Currently the windows version for Windows NT is hard coded into the
source. By running this CMake script the _WIN32_WINNT preprocessor
variable gets set to the corresponding windows version.


Thu, 30 Nov 2017 12:47:57 +0100
Author : Bj&#246;rn Blissing
Removed unnecessary define in FileUtilsThe define of _WIN32_WINNT was
added to handle an error case from MinGW
,as described in commit 712ca432196cd797cc3c265adb2847465551461f

This was later giving warnings and thus undefined for MinGW by commit
3bf6fb1778687c45d389b91675b55f709ef1f67b

Since the two operations cancel each other out, they should be removed.
