<PRE>Hi Altin,

&gt;<i>From your description I can't see any reason why the camera view
</I>matrix and image update have the view direction before the texture
update.  However, you've only provide a small glimpse in to what your
who integration code is.

I would recommend not calling renderingTraversals() twice in one
frame, this will just complicate things.  Right now you need to work
out what is going on and why, then once you understand things you can
come up with a solution.

First thing I would recommend is reverting back to the simpler frame
loop, the setting the ThreadingModel of of the viewer to
SingleThreaded to avoid any possibility that update and cull
traversals are happening concurrently to the draw dispatch for the
previous frame.  The later would likely see the video image updating
before the view matrix so you'd see the image and view direction out
of step, but with the view direction lagging.  Could this be what is
actually happening?

Robert.
