<PRE>Thanks Richard, Jan,

indeed, there is a lot of research to be done for this. I have done some
consultancy in of the the CS UNI in Macedonia with teachers who tried this
in the past so there are already some insights. I would see the first
simple app on mobile device, something like an app that will teach the sign
alphabet only ... For real translator it will take some time. And thanks
again Richard, I will ping you for sure on this...

Cheers and thanks
Nick

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I carry this idea with me from my UNI days (which is about 20 years ago)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and since recent it was just an idea. Over time it was even close to get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some funding but it did not happen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea is to have virtual 3D avatar that can &quot;speak&quot; the sign language
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; based on text or voice input. The recent technology from Google made the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; realization of  the language translation doable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I am here to ask you if someone might be interested in actually make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this happen. I personally work with an artist (friend of mine, decades of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; friendship, also worked together on various projects). And we want to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this opensource, based on OSG.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All suggestions, brainstorms, hints, anything, are highly welcome!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did some work on signing avatars 10 to 20 years ago, in an academic
</I>&gt;<i> context. In fact, several of the first page of hits for the Google search
</I>&gt;<i> that Jan Ciger posted refer to that project (Virtual Humans at UEA).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My own role in that was to create software to turn signing transcriptions
</I>&gt;<i> written in an avatar-independent notation into animation data for driving
</I>&gt;<i> any humanoid avatar, in real time. Feel free to email me for more
</I>&gt;<i> information if this sounds relevant to what you have in mind. My
</I>&gt;<i> publications on this can be found through ResearchGate or Google Scholar.
</I>&gt;<i> As Jan says, there has been a large amount of work on this, by other
</I>&gt;<i> groups as well, although it seems to me that none of it has really taken
</I>&gt;<i> off. Perhaps because it is a very niche application. The demand would be
</I>&gt;<i> primarily from the pre-lingually deaf, i.e., those for whom signing is
</I>&gt;<i> their first language. With all respect to that population, it is a very
</I>&gt;<i> small one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I would be more interested in extending my work to do
</I>&gt;<i> procedural animation of more general sorts of movement, but I've haven't
</I>&gt;<i> done anything substantial on that.
