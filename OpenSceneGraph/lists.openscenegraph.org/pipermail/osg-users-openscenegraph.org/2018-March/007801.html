<PRE>Hi,

I am the &quot;a user&quot; and this is how, from my perspective, the fix came about&#058;

As a contributor to LibrePilot that integrates osgEarth, I wanted to test the new osgEarth rex engine on Qt.
I ran into an issue, but fortunately I'm not alone and end up here : <A HREF="https://github.com/gwaldron/osgearth/issues/853.">https://github.com/gwaldron/osgearth/issues/853.</A>
After quite some research and personal investment I come up with what I consider workarounds and describe them here.
Apparently the workarounds help others too.

I look more into the issue, think I found something, so open an issue on OSG's GitHub [1] (<A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/issues/486">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/issues/486</A>).
Issue gets closed within 24 hours with useful feedback.

I continue looking into the issue and want to share my findings as comments in the code.
So I submit a first pull request [2] (<A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/489">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/489</A>). Big mistake !
Closed within 24 hours with &quot;words&quot; from &quot;openscenegraph&quot;.

Ok my bad... I continue looking into the issue and come up with some ideas for a fix.
This time, as told, I post a full length message to the forum and make proposals for a fix.
I create a second pull request with the fix proposals [3] (<A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/493">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/493</A>).
Again closed within 24 hours (great SLA btw) and I get shouted at. I am basically told go &quot;fix your app&quot;.

Day after, a series of fixes similar to my proposed workaround are committed to OSG.
And the above official message is posted to the forum informing all that &quot;a user&quot; has found an issue and describing the fix.
Why the formality ? Why the rush all of a sudden ? It is not as if the issue had any critical or life threatening implications.
Minor bug fixes never get that much honor from OSG. They usually just get committed. Puzzling...

And to finish, the killer, osgEarth then commits the official OSG fix to osgEarth.
osgEarth fully well knew the whole story as it unfolded under its eyes and regularly inquired about my progress.
Kinda bad cop / good cop situation here.

Not to mention that, the day before, osgEarth borrowed another PR of mine and committed it without due credit (the little credit I got was on my request).

Being replied to with words like &quot;hack&quot;, &quot;crap&quot;, &quot;abuse&quot; and being shouted at is not what I expect to get when contributing to an open source project.
Seems like &quot;openscenegraph&quot; is lacking basic courtesy and is treating its community in ways I have not seen elsewhere.

I'll continue to use OSG and osgEarth as both projects are great but will stay away from its community.

If you are a would be contributor, know that it can happen to you. I have witnessed it happen to other contributors too.

Cheers,
Philippe.
