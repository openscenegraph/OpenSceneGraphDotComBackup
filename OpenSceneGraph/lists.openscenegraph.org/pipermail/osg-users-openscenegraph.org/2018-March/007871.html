<PRE>Hi Alberto,

Thanks for the testing.

</I>
I haven't looked at the old CDash system, if it is working it isn't
down to me :-)

&gt;<i> I was unable to find it,

</I>
Travis Cl used to be pretty solid but these days it either seems to
race through builds in a couple of minutes or timeouts.  I presume the
Travis servers are being overloaded at times.  I've had to disable the
OSX build completely as it was failing almost all the time due to
timeouts.  With timeout failures you get a totally false picture of
the build status so there might be a point where we just have to give
up with Travis C;/

These automated build systems are no match for real people compiling
the OSG on their build platforms and testing against their own
applications.

Robert.
