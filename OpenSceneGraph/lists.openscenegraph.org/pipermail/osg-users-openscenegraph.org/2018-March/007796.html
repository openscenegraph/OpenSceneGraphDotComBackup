<PRE>Hi Altin,
just a few remarks:

you wrote:
 &gt;Steeping through the code, It seems that uploading the image is done by
applyTexImage_subload() called from within
 &gt;TextureRectangle::apply(state) called from a GraphicsThread. And this
operation is triggered by renderingTraversals(). It just doesn't upload in
 &gt;time and the background rectangle drawn by this renderingTraversal() uses
the previous image.
That's not how it works, openGL will upload the image before using it to
render. This might be slow for a big image, but the old image will not be
used. You might be tricked by a tripple buffering driver, where at the next
buffer swap you will see a render containing the old image.

2&gt; test singlethreaded. I've seen no hint that you marked the stateset
containing the imageStream texture as DYNAMIC,  so the renderingTraversal
might return before the texture or uniform has been apply'ed - trusting the
(default) STATIC promise.

Regards, Laurens.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would it help if I used another camera that also uses the same
</I>&gt;<i> ImageStream as texture and renders to a small texture, and set its
</I>&gt;<i> rendering order before that of the camera that renders the background?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No. Coming up with ever more complicated solutions to a problem you

</I>&gt;<i> solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key to a solution is understanding the problem.  Without actual
