<PRE>Hi Ali,

There is a chance that it's an OSG bug, but also still quite likely
something has gone astray at your end, it's hard to spot subtle errors
from looking at copy and pasted code rather than a full application
code.

The best way forward is to create an small test program that
reproduces the issue you have and the post this along with a
CMakeLists.txt to compile it easily - this will allow others to build
and run the test on their system to see if they can reproduce it.  If
we can reproduce it then we should be able either spot an error in the
test code or use this as a unit test for hunting down the bug on the
OSG side.

Information on hardware, OS and build tools used at your end are also
useful when hunting down bugs (often bugs only appear on particular
hardware/OS/build combinations.)

You could post the example here on this thread, or post it to the
Issue tracker on our github repository.
