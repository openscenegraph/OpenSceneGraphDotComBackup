<PRE>I've been trying to build osg on an arch system for a bit now and I'm running into some problems with newer libraries. I was trying to use the new version in the arch repo (3.2.1), but whenver I tried to load a .osg scene file, the entire computer would immediately lock up and it sounded like the computer suddenly started spinning the disk at hyper speed. You know, one of those really bad freeze ups where you can't even kill the process. I couldn't even get an error message because it froze up so fast. But displaying a basic window seemed to work fine.

So I've been trying to build 3.0.1 in hopes that it would be more stable, but I'm having problems with conflicts related to giflib, ffmpeg, and xine. The arch wiki already mentions that osg needs to link against the older compatibility version of ffmpeg and I've made two very small changes to the GIF reader class in the source to accomodate the problem with the newer giflib, but the build is starting to seem a bit ad-hoc.

How can I change the cmake build process so that it uses some older versions of ffmpeg and xine-lib? Or should I just ignore these extra plugins somehow, because I only really need osg for scene management and rendering?

Thanks!
