<PRE>Hi!
I have .ac models. One is a quadrocopter and two others are it's engines. Each engine has propeller, which i want to animate by rotation. To do it, i have to find propeler's node for the start. What i was able to find that two ways are exist.
First is to find a node by it's name.
Second is to find a node by it's &quot;unique characteristics&quot;.
Here is models: <A HREF="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByDDImhSolf6cnVIN3JIMzJQTGs/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByDDImhSolf6cnVIN3JIMzJQTGs/view?usp=sharing</A>

So the 1st question: 
How to determine, the name of the node or it's other characteristics, to be able to find it?

I developed simple program that searches a node by it's name. Something, that looks like a node's name i found when open .ac file using notepad and search for the &quot;name&quot; tag. But im not sure.

Here is code: <A HREF="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByDDImhSolf6U3BmTXpjeE1mRDg/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByDDImhSolf6U3BmTXpjeE1mRDg/view?usp=sharing</A>
The problem: NodeVisitor finds a node( though im not sure this node is a propeller), but NodeCallback doesn't rotate it.

So the 2nd question: Why the element, identified by it's name, does not rotate?

The reason, why im sure that these models should be able to rotate anyway, is that i took them from another app, based on OSG and it works well.

Thank you!

Cheers,
Elias
