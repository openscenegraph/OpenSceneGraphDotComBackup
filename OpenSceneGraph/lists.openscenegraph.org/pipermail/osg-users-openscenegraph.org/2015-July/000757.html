<PRE>Hello,

I think that you have got several answers regarding file exporters,
3DS Max and even marketplaces to this question already.

</I>
That very much depends on what exactly are you after because there are
several techniques.

OSG supports the OpenGL lights &quot;out of the box&quot;. You need to create
them by calling the appropriate functions in your code (search the
documentation for &quot;Light&quot;). I am not sure whether any OSG exporters
support lights. These lights are good for dynamic lighting, but are
fairly computationally expensive and there is only a limited amount of
them (~8 or so) available.

Another option is that you go for &quot;baked lighting&quot; and create
lightmaps in your 3D modelling software (Blender, 3DS Max, Maya, etc.)
Then you export those and use them as textures on your objects. This
is used for static parts of the scene and to give you a photorealistic
look without having to do a lot of computation.

Then there are things like screen space ambient occlusion or image
based lighting and such, but I don't think OSG supports any of that
&quot;out of the box&quot; - you would have to implement that yourself.

However, to me it seems that you have very little experience with 3D
graphics - I strongly suggest that you get one of the OSG books
(<A HREF="../../../../www.openscenegraph.com/index.php/documentation/books.html">http://www.openscenegraph.com/index.php/documentation/books</A> ). All
these basic questions are answered there.

Regards,

Jan.
