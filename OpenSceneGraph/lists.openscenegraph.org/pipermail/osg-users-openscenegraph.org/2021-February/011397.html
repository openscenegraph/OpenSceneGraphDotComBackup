<PRE>Thanks Robert,

apologies for the long delay, It's taking me a lot of studying to 
understand shaders uniforms and attributes, 
so I'm responding to your question as I go on reading and testing.

&gt;<i> Is the clipping always going to base on a horizontal plane?  
</I>
Unfortunately no. While this will be the case in 90% of the models, I need 
to have a more flexible API,
so I'm thinking to have uniforms to store reference planes (which will 
rarely or never change) and some method
(uniform or attribute) to pass the clipping distance for the relevant 
primitives.

Are there benefits in moving the objects that need clipping under a 
different group? They will always be a minority of the model geometry.

Thanks,
Claudio
