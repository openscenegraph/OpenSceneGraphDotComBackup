Amen to that.

I will only add that there are probably hundreds of things that could be
wrong, both with Aruco (it was completely unusable when I have tried it
last time, but perhaps they have fixed it since) and the integration with
OSG.

Things like camera calibration, forgetting to load the calibration data
into Aruco, coordinate system mismatches between what Aruco and what OSG
assume, perhaps Aruco/OSG clobbering the OpenGL context to each other (no
idea how you have integrated it), etc.

So without elaborating *what exactly are you attempting to do* and *how*
(i.e. your code) it is completely impossible to help you. Nobody can see
over your shoulder and/or read your mind.

I have successfully integrated both ARToolkit, Qualcomm Vuforia and my own
homegrown AR solution with OSG, so it certainly is possible.

Best regards,

Jan
