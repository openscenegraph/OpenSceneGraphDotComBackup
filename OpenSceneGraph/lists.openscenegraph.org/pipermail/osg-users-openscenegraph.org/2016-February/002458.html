<PRE>Hi Eddy,

Personally I wouldn't recommend using Qt viewer in a CAVE, Qt is all about
2D windowed application that can have a 3D GL window within them, but it's
certainly not designed for immersive displays and associated interfaces
such as CAVE.  The whole philosophy behind Qt is very alien to VR and
visa-versa.

The core OSG can handle a CAVE just fine by configuring slave camera's and
GraphicsWindow's for each side of the CAVE.  There are 3rdParty libraries
that support caves, some of which include VR specific input devices.  The
OSG has been used in VR, including CAVEs,  for a long time, right from it's
birth - one of the first challenging things I did with the OSG was getting
it running on ImmersiveWorkbench back in 2000.

Personally I'd have two separate viewers in your application, or perhaps
two applications, one for desktop experience that use Qt and one for
immersive systems like CAVE's that doesn't use Qt.  VR and desktop are so
very different experiences that whole design of the UI and application need
to be quite different.

Robert.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you!
