<PRE>Hi OSG users! Hi Robert and Chris!

Chris, I know you have already build OSG dependencies for Windows.
My first experience OSG was associated with the visit alphapixel.com and it helped me a lot.
But OSG is very large and not always specific binaries include the desired functionality.
Then I realized that I needed to learn how to build OSG itself.
It was many years ago. I used dependency with alphapixel.com.
Thank you for the good work and help.

It is interesting how the process of building the dependencies?
You talk about build automation. Interesting details.

&gt;<i> I wonder if providing binaries on gitub might be a way to go. Do other projects do this yet?

I don't think this is a good solution. But for a specific project can work.

As here it became clear that problems arise only on Windows.
My opinion is that this is due to the fact that for the MSVC compiler do not have a systematic approach 
when people talk about challenging projects, many module. But this is my personal opinion.

For Windows there is Linux (UNIX) is similar to solutions with a systematic approach.
For example:

MSYS2
<A HREF="http://msys2.github.io/">http://msys2.github.io/</A>

Cygwin
<A HREF="http://cygwin.org/">http://cygwin.org/</A>

With these projects you can use OSG.
Used the GCC compiler.

Many good open and free project that uses OSG is needed not only for him.
The successful development of various Linux distributions confirms this.

I'm developing a solution which I called &quot;Dad's House&quot;:
<A HREF="http://dad.podsvirov.pro/">http://dad.podsvirov.pro</A>

I already have a working version for MSVC2013 32-bit and 64-bit. Now you can try
OSG and not only.
The project is being established as a cross-platform and there are all the tools.
But since there is an acute shortage of binaries for MSVC - I started here.
I have the current version, as well as frozen status for 2014 and 2015.

Now I have automated many issues, but still a lot need to improve.

If you have additional ideas, I encourage them to share on the mailing lists.

Again Chris. You can download the installers here:

<A HREF="http://dad.podsvirov.pro/house/installers">http://dad.podsvirov.pro/house/installers</A>

Deflate the available modules and Repack the archive. But I can't promise that I now have all the dependencies.
I am developing a project in their spare time. Specific request can be faster.

(sorry for possible mistakes in text)
