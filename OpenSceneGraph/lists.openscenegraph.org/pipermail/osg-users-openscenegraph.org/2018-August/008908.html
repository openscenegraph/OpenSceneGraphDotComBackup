<PRE>Hi Julian,

I have been looking through the glTexStorage changes and the
background to this GL feature.

It doesn't look like to me that glTexStorage* has any functionality
benefit over just using the original glTexImage* code.  Yes
glTexStorage is the &quot;modern&quot; way to do things in recent GL version
(now part of the core in GL4.2), and yes it's cleaner if you are
writing clean room code, but I can't see any actual benefit to OSG
users who don't have to grapple with the low level set up details.

At this point the cleanest thing for the OSG to do is not use
glTexStoage at all.  We can simplify all the code paths and make the
behaviours more consistent.

For maintaining the OSG is far better to reduce the number of separate
code code paths that do the same thing but in different ways.  I now
believe the glTexStorge merges were a step back for maintainability.

Is there anything that reverting all the glTexStorage changes that
users won't be able to do?

--

For those who want to use bleeding stuff I now think you should start
thinking in terms of have Vulkan as your base.  Within the year I'll
have a Vulkan based scene graph open sourced and heading towards 1.0.
So there will be a good migration path in the not too distant future.
The pressure on using bleeding edge features in the OSG is now far
lower.

For those who have large applications to maintain that are based on
the OSG then their focus is maintaining that and avoiding regressions
when they update to new versions of the OSG.

Robert.
