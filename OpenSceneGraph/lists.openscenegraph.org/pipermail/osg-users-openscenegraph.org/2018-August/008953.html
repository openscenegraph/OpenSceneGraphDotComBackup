<PRE>Hi, all.

Sorry for this very long time to reply.

The %PATH% Variables were the solution of my problem. OpenSceneGraph is just building at the moment with MSYS.

Thank you for this Christian Schulte.

Also the tutorial of kornerr was helpful for my understanding.

I am very happy that OSG is building at the moment. It takes quite a while but so ;).

But now I have a new question. I got this messages in my log file. Should I be concerned about those and what exactly do they mean? Espacially with the ZLIB missing, JPEG missing, PNG missing

Thank you again for your support. I am really happy.

Thank you!

Cheers,
Stefan

Here comes the Log:

CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:36 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0008 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.


CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:43 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0020 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
