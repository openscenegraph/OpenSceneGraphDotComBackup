<PRE>Hi Chris,

The OSG primary focus and expected user base is real-time
visualization with such applications you won't run multiple
applications at the same time and you'll be using the OSG's native
windowing, multi-threading, database paging etc. Out of the box the
OSG tries to work as well as it can for this usage model.

The OSG isn't just about real-time visualization, even if this is it's
primary focus, it does support other usage models as well, but out of
the box I wouldn't expect all the design decisions based on the above
focus to work as well, what is important is that one can adapt the OSG
to work well for these other usage models even if out of the box it
doesn't do it perfectly.

In the case of Qt usage, perhaps osgQt could provide sublcasses from
Viewer/CompositeViewer to help adapt the OSG to work better for a
typical Qt users requirements.

Robert.
