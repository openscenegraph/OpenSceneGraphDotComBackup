Drop what?  The project leadership?  Doing support for free?

Investigating issues and getting to the bottom of them?  If you've
actually followed this thread and read what's been written I've done
far more than talk, I've been reproduce issues, finding solutions,
finding solutions for inadequacies of C++ threads and members code.

Asking members of the community to avoid being rude or manipulative?

I include you post in this, you comment is wholly lacking in technical
contribution.  Did you not consider that that your comment wouldn't
come as obnoxious/insulting.  Of all the posts to this thread you is
most inappropriate.

I have had to put up with lot of non technical crap in this thread,
lots of opinions paraded as &quot;facts&quot; that on investigation have been
proven to be pretty unsubstantiated or mis-judged. The main issue in
this thread is entirely down to users making broad assumptions and
believing that when these assumptions are proven to not always hold
they don't get the results they expected based on their assumptions of
how things &quot;should&quot; work.

Of course I'm going to get irritated when not everyone is contribute
positively to a thread, you know I'm human.

Robert.
