I think you need to trust me on the scene graph performance front.
Thread affinity is important for performance.  Future threaded support
in languages makes no difference to the cost of threads moving from
core to core.  It's the same problem no matter what API you wrap it up
with.

&gt;&gt;<i> If there was an easy and intuitive route to user control of thread

</I>
The OSG users don't always know what threads are active, let alone
what ones they need to set to get best performance.  The OSG in it's
defaults try to do the best it can for users.  It's not perfect, but
it at least tries.
