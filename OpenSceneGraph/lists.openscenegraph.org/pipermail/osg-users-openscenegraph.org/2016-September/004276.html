<PRE>Hey Robert,

Just let it drop!

Love, Temia

&gt;<i> HI Christian,

</I>&gt;<i> When it comes to perspectives of what is right or wrong for the OSG it
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely has everything to do with my experience.  I more than
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else in the community I witness how the OSG gets used across

</I>&gt;<i> support to users, fix more bug, work with users and clients across
</I>&gt;<i> many professional domains and usage cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I say something is a &quot;very specific usage case&quot; then it's based
</I>&gt;<i> on this experience. You then said &quot;you strongly disagree&quot; with this,
</I>&gt;<i> then I leaves me wondering how you can speak from greater authority on
</I>&gt;<i> how the OSG users use the OSG.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What you can say is that you know your usage model for your
</I>&gt;<i> application more than I.  I could understand how this to you is the
</I>&gt;<i> most important thing from your perspective, this is exactly what I
</I>&gt;<i> expect of OSG users and is positive thing.  However, where I feel
</I>&gt;<i> you've overstepped the make is making broad statements that your usage
</I>&gt;<i> case is the general case from the OSG perspective.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's my job as project lead to look at all the usage cases and issues
</I>&gt;<i> that the OSG users have and guide the OSG in the right direction, I
</I>&gt;<i> take not of usage cases like your own, but it's just part of wider
</I>&gt;<i> project.  Just in the same way I also need to know the wider context
</I>&gt;<i> of where the OSG sits, it's not something that is static, it evolves
</I>&gt;<i> over time.  An import thing for a project lead is that you do take to
</I>&gt;<i> whimns and move the rudder of the ship left then right randomly in
</I>&gt;<i> response to the latest greatest opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Repeatedly in this thread people like yourself have strongly asserted
</I>&gt;<i> how wrong the OSG is doing things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As spent the time investigating the issue I've found that it's
</I>&gt;<i> actually that this standpoint has been based entirely on the
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions made by those having problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The assumption that the thread affinity will not be set, and for some
</I>&gt;<i> it seems it should never be set, is building your house on sand.  If
</I>&gt;<i> you are writing a multi-threaded application one should be aware of
</I>&gt;<i> and make conscious decisions about thread affinity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The OSG and OpenThtreads don't make assumptions that thread affinity
</I>&gt;<i> will be correct in it's default, inherited state, it where appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly sets the affinity.  It may not do a perfect job in this,
</I>&gt;<i> but it does at least try to do what it can.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From what I have learnt this is is far more an education issue rather
</I>&gt;<i> than a technical one.  Partly is educating about what the OSG does and
</I>&gt;<i> why it does it, but it's also more general than this - the assumptions
</I>&gt;<i> about thread affinity being made in end users applications is clearly
</I>&gt;<i> insufficient.  This lack of education of this later issue is far
</I>&gt;<i> bigger than the OSG project.  Sadly the lack of education on threading
</I>&gt;<i> issues is not helped by the lack of affinity functionality of C++11
</I>&gt;<i> threading as an issue ignored is not one that is solved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Robert.
