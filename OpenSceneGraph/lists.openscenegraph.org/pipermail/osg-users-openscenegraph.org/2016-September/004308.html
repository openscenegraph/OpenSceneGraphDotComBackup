&gt;<i> Hi Sebastian,
</I>&gt;<i> after looking at your example I understood a shader is not needed, right?
</I>Exactly. It is one of the possible solutions. I have not fully 
understood your problem though.

&gt;<i> The solution you suggest is to apply a texture instead of changing color. In my case the image of the texture would be a monochromatic image.
</I>I don't get the monochromatic part ... Currently I left out any vertex 
colors and define the color with the texture only.
&gt;<i> If all that is correct, then I have few questions.
</I>&gt;<i> I modified my previous example to insert your solution there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Since most part of the road surface may be not associated to a &quot;material&quot;, then I thought of adding a BIND_OVERALL default grey color. Does it make sense?
</I>Not really, the texture in this example maps to all triangles, so there 
is no color needed. The mapping is uniform, linear and non-repeating to 
have an addressable element.
&gt;<i> 2) On the basis of point 1) is it possible to add a texture only to triangles affected by a &quot;material&quot;. In your example you added a texture to the overall geometry. Isn't that a problem if the road has a bunch of vertices? I mean, that bunch of vertices would be duplicated to create texture coords.
</I>What would this safe you? Effectively in my example you wouldn't need 
more than 4 vertices and still can &quot;edit&quot; the colors. As long as I don't 
understand your data-set it is impossible to give you a more elaborate 
answer.
&gt;<i> 3) In the attached example Ididn't understand how to set the image just to the picked triangle so that it will be shown of the &quot;current&quot; color. (In my example pushing 1,2,3 and 4 keys changes the current color).
</I>The image spans the whole set .. As I said, it is one way to go. The 
mapping is simply there to map a texture coordinate to a position in the 
mesh. The tex-&gt;getImage(0)-&gt;setColor(selectedColor, tc); should work 
fine, if the texture coordinates are correct.

&gt;<i> 4) I have to read some documentation about textures since I didn't understand how texture coords should be defined and the effect of:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	texture-&gt;setFilter(osg::Texture::MIN_FILTER, osg::Texture::NEAREST);
</I>&gt;<i> 	texture-&gt;setFilter(osg::Texture::MAG_FILTER, osg::Texture::NEAREST);
</I>Try LINEAR and see the difference. It basically prevents neighboring 
pixels from being affected.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) I tried to create different texture coords (see #ifdef in the attached code) but &quot;result.getTextureLookUp(tc);&quot; in &quot;doUserOperations&quot; method does not seem to work. Anyway even with your implementation of &quot;buildTexCoords&quot; the selection is pretty odd.
</I>What isn't working? My original example should work, with a slight 
offset in the picking. This is due to pixel center issues and can be 
solved by manually calculating the offset. I simply had no more time to 
make it nice...
I had a quick peek at your source: You only define 4 texture 
coordinates, where you need one per vertex .... Try to load a texture 
from file to test your coordinates


Again: You cannot share all edges really when you need to have 
per-triangle properties. You might use vertex colors with flat-shading, 
but I don't know the expected result: Does it need to look good or is it 
simply some graphical representation?

Cheers
Sebastian
