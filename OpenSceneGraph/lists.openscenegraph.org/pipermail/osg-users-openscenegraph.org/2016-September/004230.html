<PRE>Hi Pete,

&gt;<i> I have no particular desire to repeat the last discussion, but i'll say it again.
</I>
But then you'lll throw is some ill-informed and emotive language anyway.

&gt;<i>From my experience of maintaining an open source project for 17 years
</I>is that emotive language is used when people have a tendency to
manipulative rather than persuasive.

&gt;<i> It is a terrible idea, and doing it in the context of a library is just plain wrong.
</I>
There only thing terrible here is your etiquette. Please leave the OSG
community if you don't like the software or the decisions made.  It's
not like you've paid for the software or the support you get.

I've read all you have to read before and in this thread and I simply
don't agree with you.  Making the same point again and adding more
emotive terms doesn't change the technical reasons, or why the OSG
works the way it does.  The technical reasons haven't changed so my
conclusions haven't changed.

If you wan to stay then be polite, respectful even if you don't agree
with everything.

If you can't be polite and feel your conduct is appropriate then go
fork the OSG, go start your own community, you can be as friendly or
abusive as you want.

Be sure though, continuing with the tone of your recent posts is
absolutely not welcome here.

Robert.

</PRE>
