<PRE>Hi all,

I have refined the affinity support in OpenThreads further introducing
an OpenThreads::Affinity class that stores a set of CPU core numbers
that the affinity should be set for, this is then used as input when
setting the the native threading API's CPU affinity mask.

The Affinity class can be set up with simply constructors or adding
the CPU numbers one by one.  Since the new class wraps up various ways
of setting up the affinity there isn't any need for having multiple
function/methods that handle different parameters, it will also scale
to any number of CPUs that you have on your system, so if you have
something crazy like 4096 cores in your system then it'll handle it
just fine.

The class looks like:

/**
 *  @class Affinity
 *  @brief  Simple container for specifying which CPU a thread should
have affinity with.
 *  An empty Affinity.activeCPUs/default constructed Affinity
signifies that a thread should not have any specific affinity and be
able to run on all available CPUs.
 */
class Affinity
{
public:

    Affinity() {}

    Affinity(unsigned int cpuNumber) { activeCPUs.insert(cpuNumber); }

    Affinity(unsigned int cpuNumber, unsigned int cpuCount) {
while(cpuCount&gt;0) { activeCPUs.insert(cpuNumber++); --cpuCount; } }

    Affinity(const Affinity&amp; rhs) : activeCPUs(rhs.activeCPUs) {}

    Affinity&amp; operator = (const Affinity&amp; rhs) { if (&amp;rhs!=this) {
activeCPUs = rhs.activeCPUs; } return *this; }


    /** add a specfied cpu core from the list to have affinity to. */
    void add(unsigned int cpuNmber) { activeCPUs.insert(cpuNmber); }

    /** remove a specfied cpu core from the list to have affinity to. */
    void remove(unsigned int cpuNmber) { activeCPUs.erase(cpuNmber); }

    /** return true if affinity has been provided for specific CPU cores.*/
    operator bool () const { return !activeCPUs.empty(); }

    typedef std::set&lt;unsigned int&gt; ActiveCPUs;

    /** Set of CPUs that a thread should have affinity to.*/
    ActiveCPUs activeCPUs;
};

I have implemented this for pthreads so far, this afternoon I'll boot
into Windows and implement support for it.  The changes are checked
into the openthreads_affinity_mask branch.

I have also modified the thread test code previous posted in this
thread so it illustrates/tests the new API, file attached.  The
relevant part are:

        if (arguments.read(&quot;--reset&quot;))
        {
            OpenThreads::SetProcessorAffinityOfCurrentThread(OpenThreads::Affinity());
        }

        unsigned int cpuNumber, cpuCount;
        if (arguments.read(&quot;--cpus&quot;, cpuNumber, cpuCount))
        {
            OpenThreads::SetProcessorAffinityOfCurrentThread(OpenThreads::Affinity(cpuNumber,
cpuCount));
        }

        if (arguments.read(&quot;--cpu&quot;, cpuNumber))
        {
            OpenThreads::SetProcessorAffinityOfCurrentThread(cpuNumber);
        }

Note the old usage of just passing a uint for the cpuNumber to
SetProcessorAffinityOfCurrentThread() still works as its that to the
constructors in Affinity so old OSG/OpenThreads that set affinity to
specific core will still work just fine.

For users that are having problem when using C++11 threads that are
set up after the OSG's viewer is realized and sets the affinity to a
specific core , you can use the default constructed Affinity() shown
in the --reset branch above as this will effectively disable the
affinity (empty is affinity is no affinity) and allow the threads to
run on all cores.

However, for graphics performance reasons I'd recommend against not
setting affinity for you additional threads.  The right way to manage
threading in a graphics application is to make sure the thread that
runs the frame loop and runs any graphics thread run on with defined
affinity to prevent the thread jumping cores and breaking CPU cache
and pushing up bandwdith load on memory.  Scene graph traversals
primarily CPU cache and bandwidth limited so it's crucial for
performance.   This means that it's important that scene graph threads
have affinity assigned to them, but it's also important that your
other threads that are doing work don't get dropped on the same cores
as the ones handling the scene graph otherwise the sharing of cores
with multiple threads we create competition for cache and bandwidth,
which would reduced performance and increase the likelyhood of frame
drops.

The way to avoid your own threads from interferring with the main
scene graph threads would be to allocated your additional threads to
cores that don't overlap.  So for an application running on iCoe7 that
has core 0 and 1 dedicated to scene graph traversal/rendering, anuse
something like:

   OpenThreads::SetProcessorAffinityOfCurrentThread(OpenThreads::Affinity(2,
6));

Then set up your threads so they all run on core 2,3,4,5,6,7.  After
you have set up all your threads and they are running then you'll need
to reset the main thread affinity before running the frame loop so the
OSG viewer's thread are left running on the correct cores.

Then set up your threads so they all run on core 2,3,4,5,6,7.  After
you have set up all your threads and they are running then you'll need
to reset the main thread affinity before running the frame loop so the
OSG viewer's thread are left running on the correct cores:

    OpenThreads::SetProcessorAffinityOfCurrentThread(0);

If you set up all your additional threads before the OSG sets up it's
threads then you'll not need this last step as the osgViewer will set
up the affinity for you.
