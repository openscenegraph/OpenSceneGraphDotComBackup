Do you want me to apply the script to my osgQt, or do you want to
apply them to your own.

Once we feel that osgQt is ready to be used standalone I'd suggest
forking which ever of our osgQt repo's is most appropriate so that we
then have a osgQt on the openscenegraph git hub account, I then can
grant you and who else you want write permission on the project.

Just let me know how you'd want thing to progress.

One thing I was planning to do with my osgQt repo was simplifying the
CMakeLists.txt files to remove all the complex stuff that exists due
to complexity/history of the OSG project.  I have written a few
NodeKit;s over the years with simplified CMake files which I can use
as inspiration.  Unfortunately these aren't public projects so I can't
just point you at them as an example.

Robert.
