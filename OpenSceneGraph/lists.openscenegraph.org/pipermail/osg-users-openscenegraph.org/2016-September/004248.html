This sounds a bit as if this was a rare thing to do, or at least a 
design choice that can or should be avoided.  I think on the contrary, 
explicit thread handling is something that is slowly going to die for 
many applications, the future lies in futures (pun pun) and parallel 
version of standard algorithms.  C++17 adds a lot of parallel 
functionality that the user can use without caring about threads 
themselves.  The code sample that I posted yesterday is a typical 
std::future application.

What would be wrong with an osg::setThreadAffinity(...) function a user 
who knows what they're doing can use?
