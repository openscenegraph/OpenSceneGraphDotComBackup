<PRE>Hi Robert,
I think I understand what Jannik wanna means:
Dynamic meshes doesn't require the vao to be &quot;recompiled&quot; on arrays changes. The only case when vao have to be redefined/&quot;recompiled&quot; is when vas change (in case of arrays adding/removing)
So the datavariance of arrays is DYNAMIC but in order not to force the vao to be redifined at each frame (and the loossing all advantages of using vao) ones should set datavariance of the geometry to STATIC.
So it leads to datavariance semantic violation...

What I think of is making VAS a component of Drawable with that kind of code:
class VAS : Object {
void setVertexArray(Array);
void setNormalArray(Array);
protected:
mutable bufferred_object&lt;PCVAS&gt; percontextVAS;
}

With this kind of stuff ones could control the data variance of the VAS itself and not the drawable:
For the case of dynamic meshes:
-geometry and arrays dattavariance would be DYNAMIC 
-but geometry vas datavariance would be STATIC
(Further it would allow to share VAO  between Drawables at compile time)
...and everyone would be happy...No?

I'm currently trying to implement it but I would rather have your opinion first (to avoid coding for nothing)

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do *not* set the dataVariance to DYNAMIC for all my animated meshes because the performance overhead of DYNAMIC is not acceptable for me. If Drawables are set to DYNAMIC, OSG would not break frame until all the draws are submitted. I manage the updates using a double buffering scheme that prevents the buffer from being modified while the draw thread is using it. So essentially I don't need the DYNAMIC flag, but now I'm forced to use it (and incur the performance overhead associated with it) because OSG won't update the arrays if I don't. :( Previously it was sufficient to dirty() the vertex arrays to get OSG to update things. Hopefully that can be fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> This is a sticky one.  Your mesh *is* dynamic, the correct way to

</I>&gt;<i> STATIC_ALLOCATION_DYNAMIC_UPDATE or something along those line.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps STREAM might be terminology that might fit this.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll ponder on this issue, but for now strictly speaking the VAO
