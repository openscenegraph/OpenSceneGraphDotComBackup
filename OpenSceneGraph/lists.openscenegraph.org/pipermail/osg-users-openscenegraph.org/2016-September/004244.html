<PRE>Hi Robert,

&gt;<i> Have you tried setting the affinity of the threads that are created?
</I>&gt;<i> Have you tried creating the threads before the call to viewer.realize()?
</I>
Yes, both cause the threads being distributed across the cores. That is
probably also why initialising TBB early in main helps, as it creates a
pool of worker threads. For my app, you can consider it solved.
But don't you see a difficulty for OSG, if you cannot use any threading
library without additonal setup code?

&gt;<i> The way things are behaving looks to be down to the way that the Linux
</I>threading is forcing the inheritance of the threading affinity of the main
thread to child threads.
&gt;<i> I don't know if there is an setting on the Linux threads side that can
</I>change this behaviour so it's more consistent with other platforms.

I was looking for that, and my search was fruitless.
It also seems not to be Linux specific. FreeBSD seems to do the the same,
as is Windows:

&gt;<i> Process affinity is inherited by any child process or newly instantiated
</I>local process

It looks more like OS X is the isolated case (and qnx).

Cheers,

Fabian
