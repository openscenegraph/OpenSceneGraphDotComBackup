Affinity is set by default because the it will provide the best
performance for majority of OSG applications.  This might be a
&quot;terrible&quot; reason for you, but the OSG development is motivated not by
just focusing on one class of users needs or preferences, default
settings we try to do the best for most OSG applications.

Please remember, The OSG is extensible, if you don't like default
behaviour in most cases you can adapt the it. In the case of threading
ViewerBase::setUpThreading() and startThreading() are both virtual and
as such are meant for the purpose of specializing them in subclasses
from ViewerBase i.e. Viewer+CompositeVIewer and for users then to
subclass from these if they wish.
