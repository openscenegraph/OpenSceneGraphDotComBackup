Robert, I'm not quite sure what prompts you to bring in personal 
attributes here.  Nor do I see any hyperbole to begin with.  I stated 
that I strongly disagree.  You can in turn disagree.  I never was my 
intention to make this personal, and quite frankly I do not see how I 
should have.

I did not question your authority on software development in general, or 
OSG specifically.  If you think I put this on a personal level, please 
point out where.  Otherwise, please refrain from arguments by authority, 
they do you no favors.

My only interest here is to improve OSG.  For me, it doesn't matter at 
all if the behavior of OSG is changed or not -- I already fixed it in 
our code base by using your suggestion for white I'm grateful.  I can 
quite clearly see future users run into the same issues that I had, and 
I'd like to see OSG improved and not make that happen.

However, since it feels as if this is turning into something about who's 
right, not technical aspects, I'll quit the entire discussion now.

Christoph
