<PRE>Hi Robert,

I cloned tom's attempt to reduce history : <A HREF="https://github.com/blobfish/">https://github.com/blobfish/</A>
osgQtCleaned01

I'm now in the process of simplifying a bit some things, finding OT, OSG,
etc.

Something is still bothering me as OpenSceneGraph is not the only piece of
software osgQt depends on, but also OpenThreads... And the needed
OpenThreads is the one built on Qt's QThreads...

OpenSceneGraph itself is agnostic of the threading library OT is built on.
And it should, however OT is very aware :-)

The only way I see removing Qt altogether from the OpenSceneGraph equation
is to separate OpenThreads also, just like osgQt...

I'm not sure how this would simplify linux distro package creators.

Thoughts ?
