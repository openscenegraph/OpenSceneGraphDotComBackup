<PRE>Hi All,

There has been a lot of work done to the OSG over the last couple of
months to improve support for VAO, GL3+, GLES2+GLES3, some pretty big
parts of the OSG internals have been rewritten to enable this. With
the culmination of this work we are now getting close to the next
stable release.

In general the public API should remain compatible but there have had
to be a few tweaks in some places like osgText that might affect you
in your code relies with internal data structures that no longer
exist.  If there are issues you spot let me know and together we
should be able to come up with a way of adjusting your code for these
changes.

To draw a line under these recent developments I would like to make
the 3.5.6 this week, but before I tag it we need testing across
platforms.  Could you please pull down OpenSceneGraph git master and
let me know if everything builds and run successfully, or if there are
errors let me know where the problems are. The best place to provide
feedback on successes and failures is here on this thread.

All going well I'll tag 3.5.6 at the end of this week.

Thanks in advance for your help,
Robert.

</PRE>
