<PRE>Hi Rodrigo,

On 2 March 2017 at 13:47, Rodrigo Dias &lt;<A HREF="../../../listinfo.cgi/osg-users-openscenegraph.html">rodrigo1406 at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;&gt;<i> Building under linux/unix is explained in the OpenSceneGraph/README

</I>&gt;<i> Right. But you also has a link at Documentation | Platform Specific | Linux. I thought everything platform specific would be there,
</I>
There isn't really anything platform specific about building under
Linux, it's just standard cross platform cmake and make usage :-)

This page could do will filling out, and the main Getting Started
section could do with filling out a bit.

&gt;<i> So what I did was to install OSG in a fresh Debian install in VirtualBox (at least to learn how it's done -- should have done that before). I've had a few problems:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. As I told above, the Linux Platform Specifics menu could include the cmake commands from the README.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I needed to do make install_ld_conf after cmake . and before make. This could be in the manual as well, because I wasn't sure if it was the moment to do it. Luckily, it was.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. After I built everything, I came to &quot;Running the examples&quot;, and only then I've been told to use -DBUILD_OSG_EXAMPLES=1 with cmake. I tried running cmake again, and got the following results:

</I>&gt;<i> CMake Error: Unable to open check cache file for write. /home/rods/Downloads/OSG-3.4.0/CMakeFiles/cmake.check_cache
</I>
It looks like there is an error relating to the osgQt module/cmake's
Qt4Macros.  Either Cmake or Qt might have changed since we made the
3.4.0 (a year and half ago.), or perhaps debian's combination of these
wasn't tested during the OSG-3.4.0 testing cycle.

Could you try the master from github?

Or just disable the build of osgQt by setting QT4_FOUND and
Qt5Widgets_FOUND to FALSE via cmake.

&gt;<i> I don't know if it's only here, or only in Debian, but probably some other advices could be included in the installation guide to avoid all this.
</I>
We can't provide guidance on issues we haven't seen before, the above
issues aren't standard ones.  I've just pulled down 3.4.0 onto my
Kubuntu 16.04 system and it's building cleanly.


&gt;<i> Other thing, the lines below are wrong. You cannot have a space between the variable name, the equal sign and the variable value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> export PATH = ${PATH}:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph/bin
</I>&gt;<i> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph/lib
</I>&gt;<i> export OSG_FILE_PATH = /home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph-Data:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph-Data/Images
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They should be
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> export PATH=${PATH}:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph/bin
</I>&gt;<i> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph/lib
</I>&gt;<i> export OSG_FILE_PATH=/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph-Data:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph-Data/Images
</I>
Where is the above?

&gt;<i> Still another thing, the menu Documentation | Tutorials show only one tutorial &quot;Analysing a Scenegraph&quot;. I think that 20 tutorials 8-years-old are not so bad to be thrown away like that, are they?
</I>
This is why we've kept around the old tracs.openscenegraph.org
website.  We ported over most of the website to Joomla a few years
back but there are bits that we haven;'t had a chance to port across.
Please realize that this work is being done in peoples free time,
there isn't a rich sugar daddy that goes around spreading pixie dust
to magic things to happen, it takes hard graft in between all the rest
of our work.

Robert.
