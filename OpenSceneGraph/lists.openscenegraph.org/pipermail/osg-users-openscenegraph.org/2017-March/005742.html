Have you lost the ability to read in 2017?

Book's are another resource at your disposal, they don't take away
from the rest of the resources.

&gt;<i> How do OSG intend to be a great 3D base without an up to date tutorial on-line?
</I>
There

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying the tutorials in the wiki of openscenegraph dot org (can't upload the link before I have 2 posts...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> they're about 8~9 years old, and they're crashing most of the time (although I could run the first one twice already -- but they're fragile as glass: comment and uncomment a line and all of a sudden all you can get is &quot;Segmentation fault&quot;. The only solution for me was to start a new project. But the first time the Release didn't run, now the Debug don't run).
</I>
The tutorials on openscenegraph.org are not all up to date, they are
written and maintained by the community.  I don't personally have
enough free time to do a blanket update of these as I have plenty of
other OSG tasks to manage, done *free* of charge.

I would encourage members of the community to help update them where
possible.  If there are ones that aren't broken then specific
instructions as to which ones are problematic would be useful.

As a general note, if you are getting seg fault then perhaps the
problem is elsewhere other than the tutorial you are testing.  You
don't provide any information about what platform you are using, how
you have built the OSG, how you are building the tutorials, which
tutorials are a problem and where they seg fault at this point there
is nothing we can do to advice you on how to resolve them,

Also, the OSG source code distribution itself has 184
application/examples with full source code provided, each one is built
and tested so are known to work with the latest OSG, this represent a
huge resource.

Robert.
