<PRE>I totally understand your prorities (further it's release time:/) and your position on VASSharing...
(I began coding VAS-that i think you refer to VertexArrayBlock- and perContextVAS to do so)
I will not bother you until it's not (too) controversal...

But i'm not agree with you calling basevertex drawcall a hack.. 
The sacrosaint 0 draw overhead is not hacking, it's the (unreachable) absolute that drove the GL evolution this 20 last years!? ( if basevertex is hacking, what about indirectdraw? lol)

I would be glad to help you with the shader_pipeline branch but I'm afraid not to have a view of osg macro enough to help in anyway:/

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> few general feelings on the topic so you know where I stand:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First up sharing VAO's would be best done by shading a
</I>&gt;<i> VertexArrayBlock container class for per vertex arrays, that
</I>&gt;<i> osg::Geomertry objects would share.  The VertexArrayBlock would map to
</I>&gt;<i> VAO's.  At this point in time I don't think the performance benefit of
</I>&gt;<i> adding this extra level of complexity into the OSG is probably not
</I>&gt;<i> justified - in tests I did with your early VAO sharing code
</I>&gt;<i> performance was worse than the non shader VAO implementation that is
</I>&gt;<i> now in the core OSG.  You may have improved your VAO sharing
</I>&gt;<i> implementation to avoid the CPU overhead that was limiting
</I>&gt;<i> performance, but I wouldn't expect it'll make a big difference for
</I>&gt;<i> most OSG usage cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The BaseVertex extension to OpenGL is something that looks like a hack
</I>&gt;<i> for lazy OpenGL application developers that don't wish to update their
</I>&gt;<i> index and draw array offsets.  The osg::PrimitiveSet class has an
</I>&gt;<i> ofsetIndices(int) method makes it easy to readjust primitive sets when
</I>&gt;<i> vertex array are merged, so it's essentially the same feature, just
</I>&gt;<i> implemented on the OSG side and in a way that is compatible with all
</I>&gt;<i> OpenGL versions and compatible with scene graph code that traverses
</I>&gt;<i> the scene graph for things like intersection tests.  I am not aware of
</I>&gt;<i> any real benefit of base vertex for OSG users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are now not far from making the next stable OSG release, I still
</I>&gt;<i> have shader_pipeline functionality to complete for it, this is my
</I>&gt;<i> focus.  The shader_pipeline functionality will benefit the majority of
</I>&gt;<i> OSG users so in terms of bang for the buck this is where I need to
</I>&gt;<i> spend my time working on rather on niche areas of the OSG/OpenGL
</I>&gt;<i> usage.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there are small and uncontroversial changes to the OSG that will
</I>&gt;<i> help your usage case then please put them forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Robert.
