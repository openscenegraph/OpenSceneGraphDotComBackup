<PRE>Hi Robert,

&gt;<i> Building under linux/unix is explained in the OpenSceneGraph/README 
</I>
Right. But you also has a link at Documentation | Platform Specific | Linux. I thought everything platform specific would be there, but it wasn't, so I went to other sources (before remembering the README), and did the apt-get install, which scrambled my installation. Maybe you could add that part to that menu?

&gt;<i> Linux is most straight forward of all platforms to build upon
</I>
It is, but not necessarily for us who have always used Windows, and only now are learning Linux.

So what I did was to install OSG in a fresh Debian install in VirtualBox (at least to learn how it's done -- should have done that before). I've had a few problems:

1. As I told above, the Linux Platform Specifics menu could include the cmake commands from the README.
2. I needed to do make install_ld_conf after cmake . and before make. This could be in the manual as well, because I wasn't sure if it was the moment to do it. Luckily, it was.
3. After I built everything, I came to &quot;Running the examples&quot;, and only then I've been told to use -DBUILD_OSG_EXAMPLES=1 with cmake. I tried running cmake again, and got the following results:


Code:

I don't know if it's only here, or only in Debian, but probably some other advices could be included in the installation guide to avoid all this.

Other thing, the lines below are wrong. You cannot have a space between the variable name, the equal sign and the variable value.

export PATH = ${PATH}:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph/lib
export OSG_FILE_PATH = /home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph-Data:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph-Data/Images

They should be

export PATH=${PATH}:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph/lib
export OSG_FILE_PATH=/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph-Data:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph-Data/Images

Still another thing, the menu Documentation | Tutorials show only one tutorial &quot;Analysing a Scenegraph&quot;. I think that 20 tutorials 8-years-old are not so bad to be thrown away like that, are they?


Thank you!

Cheers,
Rodrigo
