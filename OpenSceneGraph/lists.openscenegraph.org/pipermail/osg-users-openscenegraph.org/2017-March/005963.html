<PRE>Hi Julien,

</I>
I'm not the author of BufferIndexBinding and haven't personally needed
to use it yet, which is one of the reasons why I'm suggesting a
concrete example of usage so how all the classes interrelate and what
needs to be done.

It may be that BufferIndexBinding needs to evolve or that
BufferData/BufferObject also need to be adapted with it.  I don't
know, I can't provide answers till I have more time looking into the
topic,

Please remember the majority of my public work on the OSG is unpaid,
looking into issues that users are having like this costs me time,
time that I has to be spread right across the various demands from the
community.  I can't know everything about every details
instantaneously.

If I push back and say I need more to go on then it's not because I'm
lazy, it's because I have too many competing items, I have to try and
make efficient use of my time to be able to handle them all.

Robert.
