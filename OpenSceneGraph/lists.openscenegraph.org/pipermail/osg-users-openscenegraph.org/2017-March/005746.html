<PRE>Hi Rodrigo,

Not sure which tutorials are you following, but if you are looking at
trac.openscenegraph.org yes, they are totally out of date. Probably we
should think in finally remove the trac. All the resources are now in
www.openscenegraph.org. Also and a part from the books which are a great
resource, ( by the way you can get an electronic copy so you can read in
your screen, copy/paste etc ) I would suggest to follow Robert's advice and
learn from the examples. IMO is the best/first place to look in order to
understand better an OSG feature.

Cheers.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How do OSG intend to be a great 3D base without an up to date tutorial

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm trying the tutorials in the wiki of openscenegraph dot org (can't
</I>&gt;<i> upload the link before I have 2 posts...)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they're about 8~9 years old, and they're crashing most of the time
</I>&gt;<i> (although I could run the first one twice already -- but they're fragile as
</I>&gt;<i> glass: comment and uncomment a line and all of a sudden all you can get is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Segmentation fault&quot;. The only solution for me was to start a new project.
</I>&gt;<i> But the first time the Release didn't run, now the Debug don't run).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The tutorials on openscenegraph.org are not all up to date, they are
</I>&gt;<i> written and maintained by the community.  I don't personally have
</I>&gt;<i> enough free time to do a blanket update of these as I have plenty of
</I>&gt;<i> other OSG tasks to manage, done *free* of charge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would encourage members of the community to help update them where
</I>&gt;<i> possible.  If there are ones that aren't broken then specific
</I>&gt;<i> instructions as to which ones are problematic would be useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a general note, if you are getting seg fault then perhaps the
</I>&gt;<i> problem is elsewhere other than the tutorial you are testing.  You
</I>&gt;<i> don't provide any information about what platform you are using, how
</I>&gt;<i> you have built the OSG, how you are building the tutorials, which
</I>&gt;<i> tutorials are a problem and where they seg fault at this point there
</I>&gt;<i> is nothing we can do to advice you on how to resolve them,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the OSG source code distribution itself has 184
</I>&gt;<i> application/examples with full source code provided, each one is built
</I>&gt;<i> and tested so are known to work with the latest OSG, this represent a
</I>&gt;<i> huge resource.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Robert.
