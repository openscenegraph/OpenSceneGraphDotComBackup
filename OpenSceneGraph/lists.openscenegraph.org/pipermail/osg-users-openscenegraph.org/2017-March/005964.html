<PRE>Hi Robert
I apologize if the term &quot;frustrated&quot; i used in the title of my post could be interpreted provocative by one as invested in osg as you are. I was a little upset by our recurrent misscommunications at the moment i wrote.
In fact, I was sure to be the only one with this problem...

Moreover, all the &quot;issues&quot; i talk with you are linked (TFFB,IndirectDraw,BaseVertexDraw..). So it's a real pain in the brain for me to find a common brainstorm start. 

For ex:
In a previous post <A HREF="http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=16470&amp;highlight=basevertex">http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=16470&amp;highlight=basevertex</A> I talk about an example code overriding osg default bo allocation policy in order to optimize drawsubmission with BaseVertex drawcall and shared VAS.Without a way to serialize this policy override I'm not able to serialize my work and would have to use a dirty post loading visitor

so the start of our discussion could be this use case...(as it really gives double performance in all bench I've done )
The example
<A HREF="https://github.com/mp3butcher/OpenSceneGraph/tree/master/examples/osgSharedVAO">https://github.com/mp3butcher/OpenSceneGraph/tree/master/examples/osgSharedVAO</A>
The minimum mod i added to remove useless calls to glBindVAO

....(when you'll have time to spend of course..:/)

Again, sorry to be a pain in the $#%% adding new problems in the bag.
