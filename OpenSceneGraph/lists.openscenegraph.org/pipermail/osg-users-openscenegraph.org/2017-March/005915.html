<PRE>HI Stuart,

&gt;<i> With this fix OSG + osgQt master branches build and work fine for my application on Windows 10 with Visual C++ 2015 and Qt 5.8.0.
</I>
I haven't done any testing under Windows so can't comment on whether
OSG master will building under Qt5.8.0+VS20015, I do these calls for
testing to get feedback from the community on things like this - there
is one of me and many different platforms so I have to rely on the
community to cover the wide range of build combinations.

If there are reports of issues then I can help work to resolve them.

&gt;<i> I also built OSG with Visual C++ 2017 for kicks and it seemed to build cleanly but I didn't test it with my application because I need osgQt and that won't build with VC++ 2017 until Qt 5.9.0 comes out.
</I>
Was it a recent OSG master that you tested?


&gt;<i> I did no code migrations for 3.5.6 but if there are any notes on suggested migration that it would be great to get a link. I believe new approaches to Qt5 integration are being worked on but I didn't look into that either.
</I>
For most OSG applications I would expect the port from OSG-3.4 to
OSG-3.5.6 to be just an issue of rebuild.

I haven't kept a list of possible changes that might affect builds as
there are thousands of changes since 3.4 almost all of which won't
affect most OSG users as they are internal code changes, or public
API's that exist to assist internal implementations rather than act as
general public controls.  When I check in that may affect the
community build against the OSG I raise the topics on the mailing list
forum to provide information and get feedback.

For users of the community I generally recommend they do occassional
builds against OSG dev versions of master so we can keep tabs on
issues as close to when they arise so we can quickly turn around
fixes.  If problems do pop up fire a quick post to the mailing
list/forum.

Cheers,
Robert.
