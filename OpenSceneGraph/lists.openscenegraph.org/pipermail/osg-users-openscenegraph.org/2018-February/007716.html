<PRE>Hi Robert

Thanks for this completness of your answer,
it could be usefull for others

I misinterpreted your review of my Readback callback, i though you suggested removing a drawcb from updatecb wasn't thread safe: it induces the idea there were a case (unknow to me) where draw and update were concurrents..:/ Thanks to lever this unrational doubt :)

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean by this, as it's really just a vague statement that
</I>&gt;<i> could have so many different interpretations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most OSG applications modify the scene graph during the update or
</I>&gt;<i> event phases of the frameloop.  Some even modify it during cull and
</I>&gt;<i> draw, but these just need to be more careful to handle the possibility
</I>&gt;<i> of multi-threaded draw.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you think a mutual exclusion &quot;zone&quot; should be defined in the main loop could be a good  way to proceed?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We'd then could define a standard way to mod sg executed in the &quot;zone&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;zone&quot; for the OSG is between the viewer.advance() and
</I>&gt;<i> viewer.renderingTraversals(), the viewer by design runs the main frame
</I>&gt;<i> loop single threaded and these traversals are all single threaded,
</I>&gt;<i> except when the DRAW_THREAD_PER_CONTEXT or
</I>&gt;<i> CULL_THREAD_PER_CAMERA_DRAW_THREAD_PER_CONTEXT are used, in which case
</I>&gt;<i> you need to set the DataVariance of the StateSet and Drawable that
</I>&gt;<i> contain dynamic data so that draw dispatch can hold back the main
</I>&gt;<i> thread till all the dynamic objects have been dispatched into the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenGL FIFO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The OSG is design to multi-thread cull and draw traversals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The OSG also is designed to have a DatabasePager for dynamically
</I>&gt;<i> loaded/computed new scene graph elements that are prepared in separate
</I>&gt;<i> background threads.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can also create your own threads and have them do work in the
</I>&gt;<i> background, you just need to make sure you are modifying bits of the
</I>&gt;<i> main scene graph that is being rendered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want some generic mechanism to allow you to modify any part of
</I>&gt;<i> the scene graph at any time you need to take a step back and wonder
</I>&gt;<i> what you are really asking for.  Any scene graph, not just the OSG,
</I>&gt;<i> has to create a world and capture that world that is static for the
</I>&gt;<i> instance in time you take the picture of it, this means that the cull
</I>&gt;<i> and draw traversals really need to work on a static representation
</I>&gt;<i> during their traversals, for this instance in time all the operations
</I>&gt;<i> done need to be done with a single time stamp, otherwise you'd get
</I>&gt;<i> different objects all moving at different points and ended up with an
</I>&gt;<i> unholly mess on screen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This means that there is natural rhythm to what is done when, which is
</I>&gt;<i> why the OSG has a single FrameStamp that is updated by
</I>&gt;<i> viewer.advance() and all the update, event, cull and draw traversals
</I>&gt;<i> all share this same FrameStamp.  You might have multiple threads
</I>&gt;<i> reading or writing, by they need to be synchronized. The osgViewer
</I>&gt;<i> itself will provide much of this threading and high level
</I>&gt;<i> synchronization for you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not a general purpose do whatever you want when ever you want
</I>&gt;<i> free for all, but it's a scene graph so it has to have this syncronity
</I>&gt;<i> to it.  There are exceptions that some applications might need but for
</I>&gt;<i> these they need to decide exactly what they need to do and when and
</I>&gt;<i> use their own multi-buffering or mutexing to manage it.  Since what
</I>&gt;<i> these exception are is completely open ended there is no way the OSG
</I>&gt;<i> can provide an API for it.
