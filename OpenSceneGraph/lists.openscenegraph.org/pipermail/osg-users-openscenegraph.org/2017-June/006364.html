<PRE>Man, there was some really great material written here.

&gt;<i> Hi Andy,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would have thought the OSG would work fine for your task, you have
</I>&gt;<i> happily mix and match 3D and 2D subgraphs (2D is just 3D in a single
</I>&gt;<i> plane.)  Portability is excellent as most of the code is pure C++ and
</I>&gt;<i> OpenGL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for for Tom Forsythe's blog, I can only guess he's never used a
</I>&gt;<i> professional grade scene graph that is well designed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Long term future of the OSG is tied to OpenGL as it's designed from
</I>&gt;<i> the ground up as an OpenGL scene graph.  If were to try and generalize
</I>&gt;<i> it to handle multiple back-end API's we'd have to radically change
</I>&gt;<i> large parts of the API and implementation, backwards compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> would be lost and with it we'd bificate the community between the
</I>&gt;<i> OSG/GL version and the OSG/MultipleAPIs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apple have been moving away from cross platform standards towards
</I>&gt;<i> their own proprietary standards.  Metal probably doesn't have a great
</I>&gt;<i> future, if Apple drop the ball on the iPhone and it looses market
</I>&gt;<i> share it'll be histoy.  I suspect Direct3D is also tied to Microsoft
</I>&gt;<i> remaining relevant, they've lost the phone market and desktop isn't
</I>&gt;<i> growing. Personally I think the API best placed for the future is
</I>&gt;<i> Vulkan as it's cross platform and provides good threading and low
</I>&gt;<i> level control support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Long term I see a Vulkan scene graph as being a successor to the OSG,
</I>&gt;<i> and on the OSG community part I think the best route would be such a
</I>&gt;<i> scene graph be developed to fit in with OSG in such a way that
</I>&gt;<i> existing OSG users can migrate across without having to dump on API
</I>&gt;<i> completely and start a fresh.  I've discussed my thoughts on this
</I>&gt;<i> topic extensively over the last two years, have done quite a bit
</I>&gt;<i> design work, but alas haven't had the time get the next OSG stable
</I>&gt;<i> release out so I have clear run at starting a new scene graph.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quite a bit of my work on the OSG in the last year has taken ideas
</I>&gt;<i> that I came up with for the new scene graph so cross pollination has
</I>&gt;<i> already started.  My plan for the OSG is for it's API to be evolved
</I>&gt;<i> whilst avoiding major API breaks, so it'll be a stable base for
</I>&gt;<i> application for years to come.  My expectation is the new dev work on
</I>&gt;<i> the OSG should start to slow down with the majority of work being
</I>&gt;<i> maintenance.  The OSG is already 18 years old, users still pop up from
</I>&gt;<i> time to time about porting from OSG versions a decade old, so my guess
</I>&gt;<i> is that the OSG will be still be relevant to many users for quite a
</I>&gt;<i> few years to come.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We're evaluating using OSG as a possible graphics backend for our
</I>&gt;<i> real-time physics simulation project, and I've got a few questions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * We suport Mac, Windows and Linux, how good is cross-platform support
</I>&gt;<i> with OSG?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * It looks like it&#8217;s pretty easy is it to hook up Magnum to an existing
</I>&gt;<i> native window, just would like to confirm. Say on Windows, I create a new
</I>&gt;<i> Win32 window, or on Mac I create a Cocoa window, is it possible to hook up
</I>&gt;<i> OSG to that window. I know that I'll have to grab the window events (mouse,
</I>&gt;<i> resize, etc...) in my app and forward them to OSG, that's not a big deal.
</I>&gt;<i> We'll be using the native toolkit on each platform for the gui, i.e. WPF on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, Cocoa on Mac and GTK on Linux, so it's important that we can hook
</I>&gt;<i> up our rendering code to native windows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Much of our application will entail displaying highly dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> deformable elastic surfaces and particle systems with programmatically
</I>&gt;<i> generated textures, do you thing OSG is a good fit? Does OSG have mesh node
</I>&gt;<i> types where it&#8217;s easy from the CPU side to update vertex positions and
</I>&gt;<i> add/remove vertices?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * We also plan to do a bit of 2D drawing (objects in a tree structure),
</I>&gt;<i> How easy would it be to also use OSG for 2D trees?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * I think a scene graph approach would be a good fit for us, as I&#8217;ve
</I>&gt;<i> worked a lot with open inventor in the past. Part of what we'll be doing
</I>&gt;<i> will be constructive solid geometry, similar to OpenSCAD,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.openscad.org,/">http://www.openscad.org,</A> and a scene graph we think is a good way to
</I>&gt;<i> represent this kind of geometry. There are however some criticisms of scene
</I>&gt;<i> graphs, namely Tom Forsythe&#8217;s blog: <A HREF="http://tomforsyth1000.github./">http://tomforsyth1000.github.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> io/blog.wiki.html#%5B%5BScene%20Graphs%20-%20just%20say%20no%5D%5D
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would tend to disagree with Jon, as I conceptualize things in space as
</I>&gt;<i> all relative to the original, and things relative to each other (I worked
</I>&gt;<i> with robotic arm manipulation before, so I tend to think in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> transforms). How would you guys respond do Jon&#8217;s issues?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * It would appear that Apple, in their infinite wisdom (sarcasm) is
</I>&gt;<i> slowly deprecating OpenGL in favor of metal. In the future, do you think
</I>&gt;<i> OSG could have different backends (metal, directx)?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -- Andy
