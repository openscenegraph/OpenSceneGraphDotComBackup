<PRE>Thank you for your reply, Robert, but one of us is not understanding the 
other.

&quot;if you are reuse the same subgraph the node above the reused part like the 
osg::Billboard is what is unique so put your unique name on that&quot;

Actually, I have only one osg::Billboard (geodeHidreletrica) for hundreds 
of hydroelectric dam icons (thus hundreds of different names). Should I 
have hundreds of billboards? Hundreds of quads/geometries? I don't quite 
get how addDrawable copies the icons to different places using (what seems 
to be) a single osg::Geometry. In which object exactly should I put each 
different name?

Thanks again,
Rodrigo.
