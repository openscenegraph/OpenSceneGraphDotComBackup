<PRE>Hi,
I'm struggling with loading animated FBX that I export from Blender. 
Nothing is visible, but it seems like something is loaded as I do see the 
correct number of vertices in the stats overlay. Exporting the model 
without animations works fine, and the fbx file looks fine in the FBX 
viewer.

I'm getting &quot;An update callback has no name, it means it could link only 
with &quot;&quot; named Target, often an error, discard&quot; logs, but I'm not sure why 
some of the boneAnimations are without a name. I have tried with this (
<A HREF="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/animated-cartoon-skeleton-9550b93d28354568adceb360981caa1b">https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/animated-cartoon-skeleton-9550b93d28354568adceb360981caa1b</A>) free 
model from SketchFab, and same result, an empty viewport (in osgViewer and 
in osgAnimationViewer) 
After some digging I think the problem is that the bounds of the object are 
not calculated correctly, and that's why I don't see anything, but I might 
be wrong. Has anyone experienced the same problem before, or is there 
something wrong with the models?

OSG Version: 3.6.4 (tried 3.4.0 as well)
FBX SDK 2020.0.1
