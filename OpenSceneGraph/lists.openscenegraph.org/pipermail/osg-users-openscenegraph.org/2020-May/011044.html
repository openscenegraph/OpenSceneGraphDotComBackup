<PRE>I've done some more digging, and the problem seems to be with the scaling 
of the animation. The solution for me is to export the fbx in blender with 
Apply Scalings set to &quot;FBX All&quot;, this fixes the problem with the incorrect 
bound.
I'm not sure why it doesn't seem to be a problem in the Autodesk fbx 
viewer, it could be that they don't use the bound of the object to 
calculate the camera, or there might be something wrong with the osg FBX 
plugin, but I don't think that is the case, the scaling code does look fine.
