<PRE>Hi Shayne,

Using a paged database for LOS queries introduces the complication that if
you need the highest resolution tiles then you need to iteratively retrieve
them from lowest to highest res tile.  The osgSim::LineOfSight class has
this support built in, but it so slow when the tiles aren't yet loaded.
There really isn't any way around this.

The crux of the problem is that VPB generates paged databases for rendering
purposes, it's all geared towards getting a solid 60Hz.  Hierarchical paged
databases aren't ideal for serious intersection testing.  The OSG can
provide tools like LineOfSight that workaround some of the issues but it
can't resolve the fundamental problem that the hierarchy of LOD levels has
to be traversed to get to the highest res tile.

As for a discrepancy between the original height field and the VPB
generated database this can come about for a couple of reasons, first your
settings, if you don't build a deep enough database then the high res tiles
won't have a resolution high enough to map the original height fields,
secondly the source height fields are unlikely to align perfect to the
generated tiles (these are aligned according to a geocentric division not a
local projection.)  When you don't get perfect alignment sampling will lead
smoothing out of the data and a discrepency developing.  In flat areas this
discrepency should be small, but in rapidly changing heightfields the
potential for bigger discrepencies is higher.

Over-sampling the generated database would help minimize the
discrepancies.  However, you can't fully avoid discrepancies when the
source data and the generated data aren't in the same coordinate frame and
have exactly matching resolution.

If you need to do intersection tests against the source data then this is
probably what you should do.  So rather than the try to co-opt a paged
database fine tuned for rendering you consider building an parallel
database and intersection scheme just for doing your intersections. I.e. if
you have a square peg and it has to be a square peg then build a square
hole to start with rather than try and force it into a pre-pared round hole.

Doing this is non-trivial, but should be significantly less work than
building a scheme for rendering purposes.

Robert.
