      It works for most of the input sizes, but fails for 8192,
      32768...
      For 8192, the method returns 13 instead of 14.&quot;

2015-03-17 09:10  robert

      C2664: 'const char *SDL_JoystickName(SDL_Joystick *)' : cannot
      convert argument 1 from 'int' to 'SDL_Joystick *'
      due to changes in the SDL api.

      Tested with Visual Studio Express 2013; SDL 2.0.1&quot;

      Updated AUTHORS file for next release candidate

2015-03-03 12:56  robert

    * src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Restructed the checks in the
      CollectLowestTransformsVisitor::removeTransforms() to avoid
      benign case being flagged as warning.

2015-03-03 12:00  robert

    * src/osg/PolygonMode.cpp: Re-organized the #ifdef's to avoid usage
      of glPolyginMode under GLES

2015-03-02 11:08  robert

    * examples/osgtessellationshaders/osgtessellationshaders.cpp: From
      Michael McDonnell, Merged enchancements to osgtesselationshader
      example from OSG-svn/trunk to OSG-3.2 branch.

2015-03-01 11:08  robert

    * src/osgGA/OrbitManipulator.cpp,
      src/osgGA/StandardManipulator.cpp: From Jannik Heller, &quot;I noticed
      the rotation in the OrbitManipulator depends on the framerate. To
      reproduce this issue, start the osganimate example, rotate the
      model with the left mouse button, then let go of the mouse button
      while still moving. You will notice that with V-Sync enabled, the
      model rotates slower.

      The OrbitManipulator calculates a scale to counteract the
      framerate dependency, but it turns out this scale wasn't used for
      the rotation yet.&quot;

2015-02-27 10:15  robert

    * AUTHORS.txt, CMakeLists.txt, ChangeLog,
      applications/osgversion/Contributors.cpp: Updated AUTHROS,
      Controbitors and rc number in prep for the 3.2.2-rc1

2015-02-26 20:06  robert

    * AUTHORS.txt, ChangeLog, applications/osgversion/Contributors.cpp:
      Updated AUTHORS

2015-02-26 19:13  robert

    * src/osg/Image.cpp: From Bradley Baker Searles, &quot;We had someone
      replace a DDS texture with a GL_RGB/GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_6
      image, which would trigger a crash in Image.cpp while flipping
      the mipmap chain. The code was trying to flip the mipmaps using
      the rowStep for the full-size image (we have &quot;dds_flip&quot; set in
      the osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options in the osgDB::Registry).&quot;

2015-02-26 18:07  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/dds/ReaderWriterDDS.cpp: From Bradley Baker
      Searles, &quot;Small patch attached to handle DDS flip when s=4.
      Currently it will omit flipping and generate a warning: &quot;Vertical
      flip was skipped. Image dimensions have to be multiple of 4.&quot;.&quot;

2015-02-26 14:16  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/tiff/ReaderWriterTIFF.cpp: Fixed typo

2015-02-23 20:28  robert

    * src/osg/TransferFunction.cpp: Fixed image allocation operations.

2015-02-23 11:07  robert

    * src/osgViewer/StatsHandler.cpp: From Arjun Ramamurthy, fix for
      StatsHandler when being used in multiple view/windows

2015-02-18 10:23  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/dds/ReaderWriterDDS.cpp: From Sebastian
      Messerschmidt,&quot;Attached you find a version of the ReaderWriterDDS
      with info outputs set to OSG_INFO instead of OSG_NOTICE. The old
      version spams the console for each loaded DDS file.&quot;

2015-01-06 15:10  robert

    * ChangeLog: Updated ChangeLog

2015-01-06 14:55  robert

    * src/osgVolume/Property.cpp: From Julien Valentin, added missing
      initializer

2015-01-06 14:41  robert

    * src/osgWrappers/serializers/osgVolume/VolumeTechnique.cpp: From
      Julien Valentin, typo fix

2014-12-22 10:35  robert

    * CMakeLists.txt: Added comment about using
      -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FINDPACKAGE_* command line.

2014-12-22 09:50  robert

    * include/osg/ref_ptr: Added doxygen comment for
      ref_ptr&lt;&gt;::release().

2014-12-18 15:59  robert

    * CMakeLists.txt: From Mattias Helsing, &quot;CMake have release 3.0 and
      3.1 and we have some bad checks for cmake
      major version when settings cmake policies in CMakeLists.txt.
      This fixes it&quot;

2014-12-18 11:37  robert

    * applications/osgversion/Contributors.cpp: Updated AUTHORS

2014-12-18 09:20  robert

    * PlatformSpecifics/Android/Application.mk.master.in: From Adrian
      Clark, &quot;Recently I tried compiling version 3.x of OpenSceneGraph
      for Android, using a recent Android NDK, only to run into
      problems with missing dependencies when trying to link my android
      project against the generated libraries.



      After some exploration, I found the problem is because the
      APP_PLATFORM variable in Application.mk is set to a platform
      number which is no longer compatible with the Android NDK by the
      OSG CMake toolchain. This causes the Android to compile it using
      the most recent Android platform libraries which (for reasons I
      don't know) no longer provide functions which OSG relies (in
      particular rand and stat64).



      This bug affects the current SVN repos for OSG 3.3.1, OSG 3.3.0,
      OSG 3.2.1 and OSG 3.2.0 (and possibly earlier).



      I posted a longer discussion of what the problem is in this forum
      thread:

      <A HREF="http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?p=62012#62012">http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?p=62012#62012</A>





      But essentially the fix is to change one line in
      OSG/PlatformSpecifics/Android/Application.mk.master.in from:



      APP_PLATFORM := ${ANDROID_PLATFORM}



      To



      APP_PLATFORM := android-${ANDROID_PLATFORM}





      The attached file will fix the bug in the 3.2.0 - 3.3.1 SVN repos
      for OSG.

      &quot;

2014-12-10 11:30  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/dae/daeRMaterials.cpp: From Farshid Lashkari, &quot;The
      Collada loader would crash while processing textures on certain
      files. I've attached the fix.&quot;

2014-12-08 11:08  robert

    * src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp: Fixed memory leak in
      RenderStageCache.

2014-11-26 17:07  robert

    * applications/present3D/Cluster.h: Fixed warnigns

2014-11-26 17:07  robert

    * applications/present3D/Cluster.cpp,
      applications/present3D/Cluster.h: Removed redundent line endings

2014-11-26 16:29  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/ffmpeg/CMakeLists.txt: Fixed deprecated warnings

2014-11-26 16:15  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/pdf/CMakeLists.txt: Fixed warning

2014-11-26 16:07  robert

    * examples/osgcluster/osgcluster.cpp: Fixed warnings

2014-11-26 16:06  robert

    * examples/osgcluster/osgcluster.cpp: Removed redudent spaces

2014-11-26 16:02  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/lwo/Object.cpp: Fixed warning

2014-11-24 15:24  robert

    * CMakeLists.txt, CMakeModules/FindAVFoundation.cmake,
      CMakeModules/FindQuickTime.cmake,
      src/osgViewer/PixelBufferCocoa.mm: From Jan Klimke, &quot;i noticed,
      that there are a couple of additional flaws when building osg for
      Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite.

      The mac os sdk version is recognized by the current CMAKE script
      as 10.1 instead of 10.10 since it cuts the version string from
      the 4th place. I introduced a more reliable version checking
      based on splitting the returned version code into MAJOR MINOR and
      PATCH parts and reassemble the OSG sdk version afterwards.

      I replaced the existing CMake code against the following
      (returning now version 10.10 as expected):

      # Determine the canonical name of the selected Platform SDK
      EXECUTE_PROCESS(COMMAND &quot;/usr/bin/sw_vers&quot; &quot;-productVersion&quot;
      OUTPUT_VARIABLE OSG_OSX_SDK_NAME
      OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
      STRING(REPLACE &quot;.&quot; &quot;;&quot; MACOS_VERSION_LIST ${OSG_OSX_SDK_NAME})
      LIST(GET MACOS_VERSION_LIST 0 MACOS_VERSION_MAJOR)
      LIST(GET MACOS_VERSION_LIST 1 MACOS_VERSION_MINOR)
      LIST(GET MACOS_VERSION_LIST 2 MACOS_VERSION_PATCH)

      SET(OSG_OSX_SDK_NAME
      &quot;macosx${MACOS_VERSION_MAJOR}.${MACOS_VERSION_MINOR}&quot;)

      Also i added the check for the new Version to some more find
      scripts.

      Additionally the nil object in Objective C now seems to be
      equivalent with a null_ptr that cannot be passed as GLInt
      anymore. So i switched this in the PixelBufferCocoa.mm to pass a
      zero instead of nil.
      &quot;

2014-11-24 14:10  robert

    * examples/osgsimplegl3/osgsimplegl3.cpp: Fixed handling of
      viewer's Camera

2014-11-21 20:16  robert

    * src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt, src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp: From Alberto
      Luaces,&quot;the current code uses the preprocessor for generating the
      plugin path in
      a way that when CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX contains something along the
      lines
      of

      /usr/x86_64-linux-gnu/

      it gets substituted as

      /usr/x86_64-1-gnu/

      that is, the string is preprocessed again, thereby making changes
      to
      anything that matches any defined symbol, as &quot;linux&quot; in this
      example
      (<A HREF="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763816">https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763816</A>).

      Quoting that path directly in CMake scripts solves that problem.
      &quot;

2014-11-21 10:21  robert

    * CMakeModules/CheckAtomicOps.cmake: From Bj&#246;rn Blissing, fix for
      ambiguous defines in Atomic.cpp when compiling with MinGW and GCC

2014-11-21 09:28  robert

    * applications/osgversion/Contributors.cpp: Copied Contributors
      file from svn/trunk.

2014-11-20 17:37  robert

    * include/osg/Texture: From Claus Steuer, &quot;XCode 6, IOs 8.1 SDK
      Compile fix : There are some undefined texture formats when
      compiling osg for IOs 8.1 with XCode 6 and OpenGLES2 enabled.&quot;

2014-11-20 16:38  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/obj/ReaderWriterOBJ.cpp: From Farshid Lashkari,
      &quot;The obj loader was overriding the existing database path list
      with the file path of the model, instead of prepending the file
      path to the path list. The latter seems to be more common
      behavior for most of the existing loader plugins. Also, the local
      options weren't actually being used when processing the scene
      graph for textures. I've attached the fix for both issues.&quot;

2014-11-20 10:52  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/Inventor/ConvertFromInventor.cpp: From Marc
      Helbling, &quot;here is a trivial fix in the Inventor plugin. In one
      code path, the pointer validity is checked after dereferencing a
      pointer that can be null (image-&gt;valid()) instead of calling
      ref_ptr::valid (image.valid()).&quot;

2014-11-20 10:45  robert

    * src/osgUtil/MeshOptimizers.cpp: From Marc Helbling, &quot;I've come
      across scenes that contains geometries with initialized but empty
      vertex arrays and primitives and that would make some optimizers
      crash.

      The submission therefore only contains a test on the size of the
      vertex array for the VertexCacheMissVisitor and the
      VertexAccessOrderVisitor visitors.&quot;

2014-11-20 09:55  robert

    * src/osgPlugins/3ds/ReaderWriter3DS.cpp: From Sukender, &quot;Fix for
      3DS reader, which may read wrong triangles. Actually, indices may
      suffer a 'short int' overflow, in two places.&quot;

2014-11-20 09:41  robert

    * src/osg/Texture2DArray.cpp: Fixed segfalt in Texture2DArray copy
      constructor where it would apply images to an uninitialzed
      vector.

2014-11-20 09:32  robert

    * src/osgWrappers/deprecated-dotosg/osg/ProxyNode.cpp: From Laurens
      Voerman, &quot;I found a new way to crach the osgviewer:
      osgviewer &quot;ProxyNode { FileNameList { cow.osgt } num_children 1
      }&quot;.osgs

      The proxy node reader wrongly assumes options to be non NULL.

      fixed in attached zip:
      src\osgWrappers\deprecated-dotosg\osg\ProxyNode.cpp

      applies to both the 3.2 branch and svn trunk&quot;

    * src/osgPlugins/txp/ReaderWriterTXP.cpp: From Ryan Kawicki, &quot;There
      is an issue where the model insets of a terrex terrain are being
      removed during the loading process. The issue is described below.

      - the issue here is that the plugin is removing group nodes if
      that group node only has one child. becuase transforms are also
      group nodes, there were cases when the transform would have only
      one child under it and would cause it to remove the translation
      portion. this would cause all the vertex data to be loaded around
      the last matrix operation, which in our case was the origin
      (0,0,0).

      We work off of OSG 2.8.1 but see that this has not been addressed
      on latest yet. I&#8217;ve tested this against 2.8.1 and have cleanly
      applied it to my local repository off of latest.&quot;

    * src/osgUtil/RenderStage.cpp: From Tim George, &quot;Currently there is
      a problem with using a camera with a viewport with a non 0 offset
      and also using an FBO. The problem is that only area made up of
      the viewports width and height is drawn based on an offset of 0,0
      instead of using the viewports offset.

      It is caused by line 991 in RenderStage.cpp:


      Code:
      fbo_ext-&gt;glBlitFramebuffer(
      0, 0, static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;width()),
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;height()),
      0, 0, static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;width()),
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;height()),
      blitMask, GL_NEAREST);



      which is not taking into account the viewport x and y when
      performing the blit. It probably should be:


      Code:
      fbo_ext-&gt;glBlitFramebuffer(
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;x()),
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;y()),
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;width()) +
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;x()),
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;height()) +
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;y()),
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;x()),
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;y()),
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;width()) +
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;x()),
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;height()) +
      static_cast&lt;GLint&gt;(_viewport-&gt;y()),
      blitMask, GL_NEAREST);
      &quot;

      Note from Robert Osfield, made small tweak to above on merge,
      changing the width+x to x+width to make it read more naturally.

    * src/osgUtil/MeshOptimizers.cpp: From Marc Helbling, &quot;please find
      a fix for the vertex pretransform visitor
      (VertexAccessOrderVisitor).
      The issue with current code is that arrays are collected *before*
      duplicating shared arrays which leads to arrays that are
      correctly duplicated but that are not reordered.

      Also the submitted patch contains a small cleaning in
      GeometryArrayGathrer as the _useDrawElements variable is not
      used; it is only set in the GeometryArrayGathrer constructor and
      VertexAccessOrderVisitor already checks that primitives have
      indexed type.&quot;

    * src/osgText/Glyph.cpp: I want to submit a bugfix for a crash
      occurring in osgText/Glyph.cpp if

      The crash disappears if I either (1) disable the use of images
      with stride
      in the (public) osgGeo-library, or (2) add the following bugfix
      to Glyph.cpp.
      This combination gives me the confidence that I understand where
      this problem
      originates from, without trying to understand the full OpenGL
      details.
