I don't know what part needs clarifying.

There are OSG examples like osggeometry that illustrate creating
osg::Geometry to represent points, lines and meshes by specifying the raw
3D coordinates, normals, texcoords and meshes.

The osganimation example creates a mesh with a regular grid like a chess
board.

The osgdalunay and osgtesselate illustrate how to use the
osgUtil::DelanayTriangulator and osgUtil::Tessellator respectively.

The osgshaderterrain creates a flat grid and then uses a vertex shader that
reads a texture for a height field and then modifies the flat geometry to
produce the final deformed mesh.  This function only modifies the Z value
using the height field, but it's possible to modify all coordinates if you
so wish, i.e. use a vec3 vertex  = myfunction( vec2(x,y) );

You could do something similar to the original mesh coordinates in C++
rather than shaders.

All these possibilities mean there might be plenty of ways to do what you
need to do, but it may also be that your particular problem domain isn't
amenable to these approaches.  You've never really said exactly what type
of data you have to work with so it really isn't possible to tell you
exactly what to do.

Robert.
