OSG-3.4.0 *is* working even better than 3.3.1.  OSG-3.4.0 has hundreds of
bug fixes, code refinements and optimizations.

Ironically, it's the fact that OSG-3.4.0 is working better w.r.t properly
support DDS format is what it tripping up OSX.

OSG-3.3.1 and all OSG version before didn't properly support DDS mipmaps so
you never got to see the buggy driver problem.

What I've seen so far points to the failure being in OSX OpenGL drivers and
nothing to do with the OSG.

To resolve the problem you need to go beyond the OSG, and on to OSX OpenGL
drivers.

If you want a short term workaround then simply disable the mapmaps
assigned to any osg::Image that are loaded.  Such a hack will work for all
data sources of osg::Image.  Remember, it's not a DDS bug, changes to this
plugin has just been the trigger for finding the problem which is
elsewhere, so there is no reason to believe that it's DDS images that
trigger, but mipmapping, so catching it in a more generic way is the best
solution.

Robert.
