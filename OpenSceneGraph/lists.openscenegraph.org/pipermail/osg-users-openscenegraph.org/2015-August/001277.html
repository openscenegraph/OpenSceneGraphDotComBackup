<PRE>Robert,

You bring up excellent points that explains the divergences I'm seeing in my results, both in terms of performance and correlation.

I do have a couple of questions then...

So, if I understand you correctly, there's no way to tell VPB to build a &quot;flat&quot; file (i.e. one that that does not have Paged LODs in it) in geocentric space? In other words, is there a way to decorate a sphere with just raw DTED data using VPB? I know this doesn't make sense for a visual database but it might make sense for other usages like viewing a raw DTED tile on a spheroid. If VPB won't do this, I suppose I can just use a height field and map it to a spheroid myself.

My second question has to do with the LODs in VPB. What is the default LOD setting for VPB? You mentioned that I might not have gone deep enough in my database? It appears to me that VPB builds LODs by default and goes deep enough based on the resolution of the original source data. For example, I ran VPB on just one tile of level 1 DTED and didn't specify any levels of detail setting on the command line. It built the database to level 6. I then did another build and specified &quot;--PagedLOD&quot; and &quot;-l 24&quot; on the command line and it didn't do anything different. It still just built to level 6...
