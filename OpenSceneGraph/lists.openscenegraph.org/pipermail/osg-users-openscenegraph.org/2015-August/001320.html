<PRE>Hi all,

The current version of OpenGL for Yosimite 10.10.5, seems to be working
to some extent from the testing I have done here recently, depending on
the data you are loading.

I have a new set of flt tiles here that loading their associated dds textures
OK, I can convert the flt.files to .osgb, etc. and they still load properly.

However, I also have another set of flt files that will not load their associated dds textures, as well as an old .ive file that does not
load the textures on Mac OSX but loads fine on Linux right now.

We are not quite sure what the differences are.  Could be
the non-working flt files were built against an older flt spec or something
as this is a relatively old set of flt files.

The non-working flt files have this for the first  few bytes:

00000000  00 01 01 14 54 65 72 72  65 78 00 00 00 00 06 04  |....Terrex......|
00000010  00 00 00 01 68 65 72 65  61 66 74 65 72 00 00 00  |....hereafter...|


The working flt files are different:
00000000  00 01 01 48 64 62 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 06 68  |...Hdb.........h|
00000010  00 00 00 01 31 39 2e 30  38 2e 32 30 31 35 2d 31  |....19.08.2015-1|

I do not know anything about the layout of a flt file, so cannot say even if
this means anything in this area, or is even enough to determine anything...

At any rate things are improving on OSX it seems, just backwards compatibility seems to be an issue to me.

Thank you!

Cheers,
Curtis
