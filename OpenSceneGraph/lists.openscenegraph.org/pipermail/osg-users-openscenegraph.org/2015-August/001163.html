<PRE>Hi Tony,

&gt;<i> Hi Robert,

Curious, as the FIND_PACKAGE(Boost) has been in the root
CMakeLists.txt since 3.3.x series.  Perhaps something has broken on
your CMake install at some point,


&gt;<i> Removing the FIND_PACKAGE allowed me to configure and build the system.
</I>
Good to hear.  I have actually looked into the FIND_PACKAGE(Boost)
usage and it was only added for the LIBLAS plugin, the usage is
perfect OK, but if one doesn't have LIBLAS installed there is no need
to check for Boost so it's not optimal.

To make things a bit more streamlined I have moved the
FIND_PACKAGE(Boost) into the FindLIBLAS.cmake script and made it only
check for Boost when LIBLAS itself has been found. I have also tweaked
the FindAsio.cmake script to do the same thing.

I have check this change into svn/trunk and OSG-3.4 branch so should
allow you to build as long as you don't need LIBLAS or Asio support.

However, while I'd hope this tweak fixes your build out of the box,
and very happy to see the CMake execution streamlined I do think there
is something broken with your CMake install, this is something you
should take up with the CMake developers, or perhaps the CentOS dev
resposible for maintaining CMake+CentOS.

Robert.
