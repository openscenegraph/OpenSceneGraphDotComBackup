<PRE>Hi Robert,

Sorry but could you expand just a little bit on what you mean by &quot;For instance if you had a data set that has two input variables that specify a surface in 3D then you could create a regular tessellation in the 2D input space then map the 2D coordinates to their final 3D coordinates - think of table cloth with a regular grid that you then scrunch up.&quot; In particular, what do you mean by 'map the 2D coordinates to their final 3D coordinates'?

Sorry and thanks very much for your patience... :-*

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks Robert. That answers my question perfectly - I figured there was a simple way to do what I wanted using OSG only but that I just couldn't find it. I'm fine with using a different approach to solve this problem. I haven't looked too far but perhaps CGAL can provide me with what I need.

</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively it may be possible to come up with solutions that are tailored to the dataset and can produce results of better quality and faster than general purpose solution.
