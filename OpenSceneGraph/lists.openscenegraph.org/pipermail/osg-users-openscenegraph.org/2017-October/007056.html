Yes, this information is what was missing form the original post message.
The solution depends entirely on the nature of what you are doing so need
this clarification.


&gt;<i> I was hoping if there is a way to get the final render buffer (for read

</I>&gt;<i> The new superposed buffer could be overwritten onto the final render

In OpenGL and OSG you can either use a accumulation buffer or render to
texture.  The osgmotionblur example illustrates how to do motion blur use a
GL accumulation buffer, not all hardware&amp;drivers support this though.  The
render to texture approach is similar to the accumulation buffer approach
but implements the functionality use render to texture.  The osgprerender
and osgdistortion examples illustrate how to render to texture, with modern
graphics cards this would be the way I'd suggest doing it.

To do render to texture you'll need to render the 3D model into a texture
by using an osg::Camera with a Texture assigned as the colour buffer to
provide the Render to Texture (RTT) , with the subgraph of the Camera being
the 3D model you want to render to it. You can accumulate successive frames
into this texture by disabling the clear of the RTT Camera using the
Camera::setClearMaks(0x0).

You then just render this texture to the whole screen as per the
osgdistortion example.

There are variations on this approach, but the above approach should be
simple enough.

Robert.
