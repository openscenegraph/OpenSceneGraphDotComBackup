<PRE>Hi Guys,

Using gihub to host tutorial makes a lot of sense.  I'd be happy to create
an OpenSceneGraphTutorial repository on the OpenSceneGraph github account
and then grant write permission to those who would like to pitch in.

I don't think the old tutorial on old OSG website would be a good starting
place, most of out of date and or awkward in implementations taking
approaches that I wouldn't personally advocate.  A clean room set of
tutorials based on OSG-3.4 would probably be better.  In OSG-3.4 onwards
there is a examples/CMakeExample that provides a very minimal CMake that
enables build of standalone OSG example, this might also be somewhere to
start for standalone tutorials.

FYI, Michael Kapelko has already done some work OSG cross platform guides
that he's posted on github:

   <A HREF="https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide">https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide</A>

This set of tutorials is nicely self contained so I wouldn't suggest
replacing this or using it as a starting place but it'd be good to keep
things coherent in some way, perhaps even moving Michael's repo into the
offical OpenSceneGraph would make sense, but still have this sit in
parallel to other Tutorial efforts.

Robert.
