<PRE>Hi Bj&#246;rn,

&gt;<i> First of all Michael Kapelko's tutorials looks amazing. He must spent a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't have a problem with video tutorial's, but as you say if API's
change then videos need to be re-shot, but then other resources have to be
redone anyway.  If one can make vidoes in a lightweight way then the cost
of videos might not be too high.


&gt;<i> My idea of converting some of the older tutorials to github pages was
</I>&gt;<i> mostly meant as proof-of-concept to test out the technology. But I agree
</I>&gt;<i> with you Robert that we should not copy the old but instead create a new
</I>&gt;<i> set of modern OSG tutorials. Before we start doing these I think we need to
</I>&gt;<i> have an outline of the &quot;curriculum&quot;. We also need to think of the target
</I>&gt;<i> audience. What should the prerequisite knowledge level be? Knowing C++ and
</I>&gt;<i> basic computer graphics??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We do occasional get new users that appear to lack knowledge of basic
programming or computer graphics, this is an extreme, but it does happen
from time to time.  We also get new users who are super experienced,
talented and want really specific documentation on advanced topics.
Sometimes you get people who lack my experience and knowledge but demand
the advanced stuff way before they are ready :-)

I know this doesn't help much, but I say to give a bit of context to what
the community might want, i.e. everything, yesterday...

So rather than keep asking what people want/need I would suggest keep your
contributions to things you feel inspired to contribute.  There is a danger
of this being a bit too adhoc so a bit of community discussion is value,
but in the end I think we'd need to have to make it easy to
contribute/maintain tutorials and make them fun to do.  Systems like github
and CMake are pretty cool tools in easing much of this task.

How things fit into the wider project, one thing perhaps we need to do as a
community is do a top down review of how the developers come across and
start using the OSG, how they join the community, what resources.  What
path users might want to take through this will be different based on their
experiences and needs, so I guess review things from different user
profiles would probably be appropriate.  Right now I feel our
website/resources are a bit too adhoc.

Robert.
