<PRE>Hi Julien,

I have begun my old build tests and have merged master into osganimation
branch and checked this in, and then fixed the build problems when
compiling with OSG_USE_REF_PTR_IMPLICIT_OUTPUT_CONVERSION set to OFF.
These changes are all checked into the osganimation branch.

I have begun looking at source code and find the style used a bit awkward
and rather different from the rest of the OSG.  I know this will have been
partly been down to what it's been like prior to your changes.  I don't
find the style used for spacing and indentation helps readability - there
are some very odd choices where therearenowspacesbetweenstuff and then
bits     that have     an        odd     segments of     code       where
the spacing     is        very      spacious for     no apparent
reason.

I don't know how practical it is for me to go through all osg osgAnimation
and headers to fix things.  In the past I have used code beutifiers with
varying success.  Perhaps there are modern tools now that can do a better
job and worth trying out.  I welcome suggestions on what tools there might
be.  What I'd like to arrive at is an osgAnimation headers and source that
look like the rest of the OSG.

There is a conflict on this change that github is reporting:

   <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/374">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/pull/374</A>

Thoughts?

OK.  So we are now at a point where we need wider testing.

Personally I have not been a serious user of osgAnimation so haven't got
much experience or test cases to draw from so need yourself and the rest of
the community to hammer it hard.

Robert.
