When I shortly after I first announced the vertex_array_object branch
I asked for feedback on OSX GL3 core profile support and got feedback
that the new VAO support for functioning and enabling GL3 usage under
OSX.

I don't have a OSX system so can't personally test, the best I can do
provide general directions for others who have OSX to do testing and
roll in any fixes that are required.

For yourself I would recommend having a look through the threads on
VAO over the last two months looking for discussions on the OSX, this
might help you on your way.

You'll also need patience, Apple over the years have made various
changes that break builds and runtimes, or limit functionality to a
narrow set of usage cases. Over the years I have worked under OSX at
different points, but these days I'm more than happy to stay away from
OSX, Apple have moved the goal posts so many times that it's a painful
platform to support.  I say this prepare you for the effort required
to port and then maintain your application on OSX, giving you the
required time and resources for OSX  support is something that your
management will need to be aware of and supportive of.

On the OSG side I can't wave a magic wand and fix all the problems,
one of the main motivations for adding VAO support to the OSG was
fixing things under OSX.  I spent 6 weeks work unpaid on this to make
it possible but as I don't have OSX I can't do the final testing.
Others in the OSG that have OSX will need to help refine things if
they need it and support each other.

Robert.
