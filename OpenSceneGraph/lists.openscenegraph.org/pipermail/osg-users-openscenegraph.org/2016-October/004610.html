</I>
I am not aware of any outstanding bug in the OSG that causes problems
like you describe.

However, what you describe is pretty vague, you don't specify what OSG
version, what platform, what you mean by &quot;stops&quot; rendering, whether
you see a crash, or any warnings, how you are deleting &quot;views&quot;, how
you are managing the multiple views.

There could be a quite a few mistakes in how you application is
working that could cause problems but as it's not possible to infer
exactly what you are doing there is no way for us to spot the error in
your application or if it does turn out to be on the OSG side.

The best way would to explain in more detail how your viewer and the
various views are set up, how they are deleted, how the scene graph is
managed during the lifetime between views being created and destroyed,
what happens with graphics windows during this lifetime.  Think about
what information others would need to write a test program that would
reproduce the same issues that you are seeing, this is the information
we need.

One better than just telling us this would be to write a small example
that illustrates the issue so we can reproduce the issue.  This route
requires a bit of effort on your part but is the by far the most
reliable way to resolving issues as it removes ambiguity about the
problem entirely and can be used directly as a unit test - if there is
a bug in the OSG then once it's fixed this example would work, if it's
not a bug then a fix to the small example would make it nice and clear
what you need to fix in your own application.

Robert.
