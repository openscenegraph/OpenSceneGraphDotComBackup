<PRE>Hi Mathieu, 

Here is a summary of what I did to get it to compile in MSVC 2015. 

at line 130 where is says 
SET(OPENSCENEGRAPH_SOVERSION 145)

add the following lines that set the version numbers
SET(OPENSCENEGRAPH_MAJOR_VERSION 3)
SET(OPENSCENEGRAPH_MINOR_VERSION 5)
SET(OPENSCENEGRAPH_PATCH_VERSION 6)

Otherwise MSVC will throw an error: RC2127 version WORDs separated by commas expected	

delete the following lines as they are not needed
# 3rd Party Dependency Stuff
IF(WIN32)
    INCLUDE(Find3rdPartyDependencies)
ENDIF()

At this point MSVC threw an error that it could not find a baseclass for fstream is OSGDB, the problem is that fstream is also an include in OSGDB include folder... in essence it was not &quot;finding&quot; the std:: include files in the MSVC directory.  I am not sure why, something to look into.  I just manually copied the absolute directory path to point the compiler to the exact file in my MSVC include folder.

IE #include &lt;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\include\fstream&gt;

It did this a few more times where there were std:: functions. I just added the path by hand to the header and it finally compiled.  It was interesting since I do see the path for the MSVC includes sitting there in the build system paths.  Not sure why the compiler is not finding them.
