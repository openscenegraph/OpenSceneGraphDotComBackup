<PRE>Hi,

  Just curious how things are proceeding with this process.

I saw Roberts request to test the latest 3.5.6 Master branch with the
new vertex buffer changes  and would like to try and do that
but our entire baseline relies heavily on osgQt being present
to build against.

We are mainly a Linux house, but also have some Windows
and MacOSX requirements from time to time.

My first attempt to clone out the latest osgQt kit from GitHub
does not allow me to run cmake on it successfully as
a standalone project/directory on my system.   I looked around
a bit and I do not see how to actually get cmake to properly
setup the project to build with OSG now that its been
separated.

Can someone point me in the direction to find a set of
instructions to follow or possibly give me some hints on
how to get osgQt built against the current 3.5.6 master branch
of OSG.  I have a little bit of time right now so, any info would 
be greatly appreciated so that we can start to provide back some feedback on the latest master branch of OSG as well as this 
new osgQt project.

... 

Thank you!

Cheers,
Curtis
