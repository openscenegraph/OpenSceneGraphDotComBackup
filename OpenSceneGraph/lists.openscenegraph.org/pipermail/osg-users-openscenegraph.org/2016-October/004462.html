<PRE>Hi Curtis,

Thanks for testing things out.

Potentially we could de-instate the osg::State::dirtyTexCoordPointer()
as there osg::VertexArrayState takes over this functionality, you can
get the current VertexArrayState via
state.getCurrentVertexArrayState().  I removed the functions like
dirtyTexCoordPointer() to help make sure the rest of the OSG doesn't
rely on deprecated methods.  I wasn't expect it to be used widely by
users.  Is there code you had to modify open sourced?  If so could you
point me at it so I can work why it's being used and the way it's
being used.  This might help inform how to adapt things.

For OSG-3.6 it would be ideal to smooth out glitches that end uses are
seeing so any assistance on homing on what the issues are will really
help in this.

Robert.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did some very basic testing of this for you yesterday.  There is
</I>&gt;<i> no need to respond back to me with any possible fixes or anything,
</I>&gt;<i> I am just passing this along to you for your information right now.
</I>&gt;<i> We have no plans on updating our OSG version in the near future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was able to successfully compile the release on OpenSuSE 13.2 64bit Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next I recompiled our Opensource OpenIG application against this release and everything compiled OK, with exception of one minor change to the source code for a missing function:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> osg::State* state = renderInfo.getState();
</I>&gt;<i> #if OSG_VERSION_LESS_OR_EQUAL(3,5,3)
</I>&gt;<i>         state-&gt;dirtyTexCoordPointer(1);
</I>&gt;<i> #endif
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used 3.5.3 above only because that is what I know for sure as I do not
</I>&gt;<i> have a copy of 3.5.4 to check against.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After this change our OpenIG application runs with no segv's, however
</I>&gt;<i> there are a number of visual issues noted with the 3.5.6 master:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  The one FBX model in the scene is not positioned properly anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>      Although the shadow for it seems to still be in the correct location and
</I>&gt;<i>      even shows the animation of that model, even though visually the
</I>&gt;<i>      model itself is not in that location anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.. There appears to be something going on with our terrain shaders too
</I>&gt;<i>      as when I change the TOD to 10:00, the terrain all turns bright white
</I>&gt;<i>      from its normal textures.  In fact just moving around in the scene
</I>&gt;<i>      also results in the terrain textures disappearing totally.
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Seems that our F+ lighting implementation will also need some
</I>&gt;<i>      adjustments as it appears not to be rendering properly anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know very little about how the shaders were implemented in
</I>&gt;<i> this application as most of this was done by our consultant, just passing
</I>&gt;<i> on some of the basic results as I seem them right now for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of  this is working properly in the 3.5.3 version we have been using
</I>&gt;<i> so at some point between this and whats on the master branch now these
</I>&gt;<i> visual changes have shown up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow I know its just some very basic info, but I figured I would pass
</I>&gt;<i> it along for you in case this is not what you might have expected with
</I>&gt;<i> this latest release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We will be curious to see what if anything anyone else reports back to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Curtis
