&gt;<i> We are having a bit of an internal argument about using OSG 3.4 as a scene graphs vs the scene graph in QT3D2.0 (QT 5.7) for a QT Windows/C++ widget app. We are already familiar with OSG 3.3 in a Windows/MFC application - that's obviously a reason to use OSG. But QT3D 2.0 seems quite easy to use as well. Maybe someone has more experiences with the Pros/Cons.

I don't know much about QT3D so can't only make general suggestions.
I don't think others will be able to help you with the specifics as
only you know what features you'll need from your scene graph, what
existing code you'll be able to leverage or not, and what other
platforms you might need to support.

On the OSG side what you have is an established professional grade
scene graph with a sizeable community behind it.  The OSG has many
image and 3d models loaders, support for threading, including a
sophisticated database paging architecture. it's possible to port
between OpenGL and OpenGL ES (OSG-3.6 will make this easier too.) The
OSG also can be used with any windowing toolkit so you aren't tied to
QT for the lifetime of your application - if your application is
successful you may need to port it to other platforms in the future so
having this flexibility could be very useful.

Best of luck with your project.
Robert
