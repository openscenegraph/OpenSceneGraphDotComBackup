<PRE>Hi Mathieu,

One other thing that is also not any sort of priority or
any sort of bug report for you to concern yourself with, but
maybe you know something about it with your work on this
project.

The attached PIC to this reply is what I get when starting
the osgviewerQt example.  You will notice the left larger  window
only contains one model instead of the 4 models that it should
have.  Just was running the example after building it and
it reminded me of seeing this again.

The 4 models show up properly as soon as I touch the window
and resize it.  Minimizing it or covering it up and then uncovering
does not fix it, it needs a resize event to finally show the correct
output, doesn't matter if its sized larger or smaller.

This linux system has QT 5.4.2 installed on it right  now, I want to
say this behavior started with the first version of Qt5 we started
to use after our linux distro finally updated from 4.8.x.

Anyhow, just curious if you have seen this at all with your Qt work
and if this is actually a Qt bug that we have to live with until they fix 
it or its something in the osgQt implementation.

We get the same as I recall when we run this on our development
Mac as well, not sure about windows we don't have the examples built
on that platform right now for me to test it at the moment.

... 

Thank you!

Cheers,
Curtis
