<PRE>Hi Uma,

I made a mistake earlier in suggesting the OT version you had was the
latest, I checked it against my git checkout without realizing that I
had been doing working on the OSG-3.4 branch a few days ago.

The stack trace error suggests that you have built OT using Qt
threads.  I haven't done this personally - other members of the
community developed the Qt threads support in OT as well as osgQt so I
can't really help out with it as I don't have the specific expertise
or the software platform to test.

For problems that don't involve Qt+OSG I can have a bash, but this
combination I'll have to defer to others in the community as Qt adds
it's own very specific issues.

Robert.
