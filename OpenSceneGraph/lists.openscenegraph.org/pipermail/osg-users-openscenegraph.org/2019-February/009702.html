<PRE>Hi Kris,

The OSG source code is a resource that you can use to answer all the
questions you might have, so I would recommend just getting to know
the code base and the underpinnings on classes like
osgGA::GUIEventAdapter.

The OSG doesn't poll the mouse x,y position each new frame, it only
tracks mouse position though the osgGA::GUIEventAdapter objects
generated by mouse move, mouse drag and mouse press/release events.
The mouse position is cached and passed on to new non mouse events for
your convenience.

Robert.
