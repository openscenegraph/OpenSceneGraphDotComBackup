Uh, these two points are unrelated I think!

First thing - it&#8217;s never been necessary to have Qt handle the main application loop : so long as you call QCore|Gui\Application ::proccessEvents periodcilly, eg once per frame. That&#8217;s true since 4.x

Second thing, rendering in QtQuick 1 vs 2 (i.e Qt 4.x vs Qt5) changed completed, so yes most concepts are different. There&#8217;s several different ways to do OSG + QtQuick, some are easy but restrict OSG to rendering in the QtQuick render thread, which still gives overlapping of the main-thread and GL drawing. What I&#8217;m trying with the QQuickRenderControl stuff is to make a maximally performance solution for Flightgear which is compatible with /all/ the OSG threading modes. At the moment I&#8217;m not sure how well I will succeed.

Alas, no one replied to my message here about running tasks before the rendering starts, but I think I&#8217;ve worked out a solution, with some restrictions. I didn&#8217;t have time to work on this stuff in the past week, so a little more patience is needed before I can try out my theories.

Kind regards,
James
