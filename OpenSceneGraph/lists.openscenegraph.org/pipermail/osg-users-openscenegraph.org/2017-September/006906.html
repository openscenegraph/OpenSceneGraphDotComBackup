<PRE>Hello,

Related to my other post about integrations with QtQuick, to achieve optimal performance I need to run a task on the graphics thread with some very particular timings, and I&#8217;m hoping for some advice on the most compatible way to achieve that. Especially, I&#8217;d like a solution which is compatible with all, or most, of the OSG threading modes.

To explain, QtQuick can be rendered in &#8216;foreign&#8217; rendering contexts and threads (such as OSG&#8217;s graphics thread). There is a basic render function which does the bulk of the drawing, and this does no cross-thread communication; hence it&#8217;s well suited to be run in a Drawable&#8217;s drawImplementation or an osg::Camera post-draw callback. And I expect that my QtQuick content will be rendered as a HUD or overlay so I expect this part to happen almost at the end of the graphics thread&#8217;s frame, right before the swap.

However, there is a pre-phase (the sync phase), which needs to be run with the main thread blocked, which synchronises data, but may also make OpenGL calls : for example creating textures or buffers, or uploading shaders. Often it does nothing (if the QtQuick scene didn&#8217;t change that frame). What I&#8217;d like is for the graphics thread (assuming it exists) to run this task as early as possible in the frame, and definitely before osgViewer::frame returns; I guess this is conceptually the same as waiting on the dynamic objects guard which also blocks frame() from returning control to the main thread.

I&#8217;ve read the implementation details of osgViewer::frame (and ViewerBase) of course, but I&#8217;m still not certain what is really the nicest way to achieve what I need, while keeping the maximum possible amount of overlap between the main thread and graphics thread. (Fortunately I don&#8217;t think the cull threads are affected at all by this integration)

Any suggestions appreciated!

Kind regards,
James
