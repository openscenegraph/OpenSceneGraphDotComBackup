<PRE>wow
It seams you're clearly overthinking required command line arguments..
try using 
Code:
cmake-gui %OSG_ROOT% 

 instead
..and don't forget to delete CMakeCache.txt..
Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> I am not such an expert in CMake to say it for sure. In fact, I basically only know how to use it. Never did a sophisticated script myself. But it looks to me that some CMakeLists.txt in OSG v3.4.1 has a problem when building for MSVC in debug (and in my particular case in 64 bit but I think this is not relevant).&#160; In short, it &quot;fails&quot; when installing with this command 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  cmake --build . --target install --config Debug -- /p:Platform=x64 /m:8
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> And the problem is that the installation script looks for pdb files of OSG applications (e.g. osgviewerd.exe and whatnot) which are not created. This happens after all the usable files have been installed. So one could disregard this error value returned. After all, what it is partially installed seems to be usable. But if you are building OSG in an automated fashion this flags the build as failed and it stops all the build system. 
</I>&gt;<i> However if the solution files are generated with the -DBUILD_OSG_APPLICATIONS=no parameter, the build and installation works smoothly (though of course you won't have the applications built but maybe that is ok for some). 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the solution here seems to be that either the .pdb files are created for the applications too, or the install target for the applications doesn't try to install them. What happens now (in my machines at least) is exactly the opposite. Applications don't generate the .pdb files and the install script is trying to install them. 
</I>&gt;<i> As I said before, I am not that cmake-skilled to spot where the problem is within all the scripts and provide a solution. But it would be nice if someone could.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
