<PRE>Hi list.

I am not such an expert in CMake to say it for sure. In fact, I 
basically only know how to use it. Never did a sophisticated script 
myself. But it looks to me that some CMakeLists.txt in OSG v3.4.1 has a 
problem when building for MSVC in debug (and in my particular case in 64 
bit but I think this is not relevant).&#160; In short, it &quot;fails&quot; when 
installing with this command

  cmake --build . --target install --config Debug -- /p:Platform=x64 /m:8

And the problem is that the installation script looks for pdb files of 
OSG applications (e.g. osgviewerd.exe and whatnot) which are not 
created. This happens after all the usable files have been installed. So 
one could disregard this error value returned. After all, what it is 
partially installed seems to be usable. But if you are building OSG in 
an automated fashion this flags the build as failed and it stops all the 
build system.

However if the solution files are generated with the 
-DBUILD_OSG_APPLICATIONS=no parameter, the build and installation works 
smoothly (though of course you won't have the applications built but 
maybe that is ok for some).

So, the solution here seems to be that either the .pdb files are created 
for the applications too, or the install target for the applications 
doesn't try to install them. What happens now (in my machines at least) 
is exactly the opposite. Applications don't generate the .pdb files and 
the install script is trying to install them.

As I said before, I am not that cmake-skilled to spot where the problem 
is within all the scripts and provide a solution. But it would be nice 
if someone could.

Thanks.
