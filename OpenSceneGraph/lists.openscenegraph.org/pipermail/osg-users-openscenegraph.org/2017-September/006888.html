<PRE>I'm currently in the process of trying to make shadows work in OpenMW and
&gt;<i> am therefore trying to learn about osgShadow and also convince it to do a
</I>&gt;<i> bunch of things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
With osgShadow we've tried quite a few different approaches to provide a
general purpose shadow implementation, each technique has different
strengths and weaknesses.  As things stand there isn't any one approach
that works well in a wide range of tasks.

Personally, these days with applications having their own shaders and
mutlipass technique I feel that osgShadow is less and less the best tool to
use.  Instead I would suggest coming up with a shadow implementation that
is tailored to the needs of your application.  This does mean leaning more
about how to implement shadowing so slower to get up to speed, but long
term it's likely to be better.

Many thanks for any answers,

Really?  AnyOldName3 is a crap, stupid, insulting to everyone else name.
It's not clever or respetful to others in the community.  Forum's/mailing
lists are poor substitute for face to face conversation, one way we can try
to round of the edges is by community in human ways  Please come up with a
more grown up pseudonym if you can't use your own name.  There are so many
cool names in fiction that you could pick, go be creative.

Robert.
