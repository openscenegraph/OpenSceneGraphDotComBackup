<PRE>Hi Zachary,

This part is very likely put of date, this page will have been written
in the OSG-2.x days, long before OSG-3.x and use of Cmake.

As I have no Cygwin experience I could not make any judgement on this
comment in the docs.  I edited it to update best I could given what I
know.  The fact that these docs were so out of date is a reflection on
how few people under WIndows use Cygwin.  Those engineers who do
decide to go this route need have a high level of expertise in sorting
things out themselves than those engineers that adopt more platform
standard tools, under Windows this is VisualStudio.

Personally I'm a Linux user, I find it's a far easier platform to to
develop with as all the tools and dependencies get pulled in from
repositories.

If you do want to use Cygwin an there is no other engineers here that
are actively using it to help you with specific advance then you'll be
the one among us that can make judgement calls on what is now needed.
The best we can do is try and provide general guidance.

Robert.
