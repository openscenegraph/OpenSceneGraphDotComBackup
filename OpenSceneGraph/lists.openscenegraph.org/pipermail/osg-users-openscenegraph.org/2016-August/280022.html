<PRE>Hello,

 

I like double adverbs..J.J

 

Roberts state of OSG slides were extraordinarily clear and concise and well
received.

 

Prabhat Godse from Biodigital  gave a very nice talk on an Anatomy app built
with OSG for 3D visualization.

       Nice app. Google or Bing for Biodigital.

       Great comments on using Xcode and compilers for Android and lessons
learned when building OSG based apps.

       &quot;John: So, Prabhat, when 3.6 is released how easy will it be to build
and develop for?&quot;

       &quot;Prabhat: It will be so easy...J.J&quot;

 

Then David Glenn [the lucky individual in Robert's slides being the talking
head for Robert's slides] gave Robert's slides on what is a next generation
scengraph going to look like. .J.J

 

Thanks to Robert, David and Prabhat.

 

Oh, and David had multicolored tape to tape down the power cords and had a
4K resolution projector. BOF setup was SO easy.J.J
