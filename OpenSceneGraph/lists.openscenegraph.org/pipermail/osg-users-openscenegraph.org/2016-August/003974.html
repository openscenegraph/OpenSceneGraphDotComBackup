<PRE>Hi Robert,

The glitches are purely visual. I have no overlapping ranges, my problem 
is the opposite - when I'm moving towards a level and the range 
switches, it takes a while to load the high level and the low level is 
switched off. While loading, there is just empty space for a while until 
the high level has been loaded and is visualized.

Attached is an attempt to illustrate the problem. When moving from 
position 1 to 2, the middle level is switched out and although the high 
level is within its range it takes a while to load it, so there is a 
hole until it's finally been loaded in 3. Note that I don't have to move 
the viewer between 2 and 3, just wait for the loading. I would want the 
middle level to be visible until the high level is actually loaded.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding something about PagedLOD, the database pager, 
or how to create quad-tree scene graphs for it to work properly? I have 
only developed these things myself before in other projects, and 
actually not used PagedLOD until now.

Regards,
Andreas
