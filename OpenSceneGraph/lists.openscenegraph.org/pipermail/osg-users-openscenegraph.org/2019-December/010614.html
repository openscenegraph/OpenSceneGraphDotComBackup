<PRE>I am only doing setCompileOnNextDraw, after the load of my main scene. If I do not do it, then I get a lot more severe hangs.......however after some further test I ran into some complications. I have a user set option to use this or not. I found if the scene is larger than what can fit on the GPU, I am better off not doing this.

I am currently running nodes with 3-4 projectors per node, 2 video cards per node. Each projector runs has its own process. What I found from running a profiler is glGet*, caused periodic hangs, this included:  

glGetInteger64v(GL_TIMESTAMP, &amp;timestamp); 

I setup a condition around where said line is used so it is not being run unless stats are enabled. So it turns out when I run without stats enabled, I get a lot fewer hangs.......but it makes it harder to quantify without stats. I am doing ground based simulation, so I have pretty high optical flow rates so dropped frames are really noticeable. I don't really see this on my development machine, or not to the same degree. My deployment machines are older and are running multiple processes. So...problem solved.....maybe? 

I am still getting 100's of :
Warning: detected OpenGL error 'invalid enumerant' at after stateset.compileGLObjects in GLObjectsVisitor::apply(osg::StateSet&amp; stateset)

After setCompileOnNextDraw, and I am still concerned about these messages. I have not tracked down exactly what objects being compiled at the time are......or if it's every object for that matter. 

I was also looking at the shared state manager, I am using OSG 3.6.3. Is there anything in particular I should do to use this?

I am doing a setCompileOnNextDraw on each render for each camera , (I typically only have 1) loading my scene. 

After doing thing I am getting a large number of error messages:

Warning: detected OpenGL error 'invalid enumerant' at after stateset.compileGLObjects in GLObjectsVisitor::apply(osg::StateSet&amp; stateset)

It also seems that I am getting a large number of hangs. It looks like I have plenty of free memory on the GPU. I am pretty sure this is from loading textures.

 When should you use setCompileOnNextDraw? Has any else scene this issue before?

Hi All,

Our old forum was generously created by a member of our community, but a number of years ago the creator/manager of the forum moved on work in an area unrelated to the OpenSceneGraph so the forum no longer had a maintainer, finally the old server that was hosting has gone too.

Previous discussions in the community didn't come up with a replacement, and as I don't have any expertise in this direction myself I have adopted the osg-users mailing list mirror on googlegroups as the forum, so now when you go to forum.openscenegraph you'll be redirected to:

  <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osg-users">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osg-users</A>

The googlegroup doesn't have a record of the membership to the old forum, and I don't have a record either, so to use the new googlegroup forum you'll need to register with it.

Alternatively, you can use the original osg-users mailing list, and posts will be crossed posted automatically.

Cheers,
Robert.

CompileOnNextDraw is a feature that is meant to be used sparingly such as on start up when you are first pre compiling all new GL objects to prevent incremental compiles from breaking frame later in the app run.

First thing you should do is remove that call and see what happens.

Do you have an idea why this line was added?

Robert.
