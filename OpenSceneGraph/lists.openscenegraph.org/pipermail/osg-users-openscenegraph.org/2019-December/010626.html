<PRE>The explanation and code snippet doesn't tell us enough of what is going on 
in your app to be able to guess what might be wrong.

The best thing I can do at this point is flag up a couple of issues in the 
code that could be improved, or flag up stuff that seems odd.

First up a memory leak:

      osg::Group* model = dynamic_cast&lt;osg::Group*&gt;(osgDB::readNodeFile(
fileName, dbOptions));

       if (model != nullptr)

       {...


This code will only assign the loaded object the m_Root if the loaded model 
root node is a Group, if isn't then it'll just be leaked, never to be 
deleted.


The best way to do a read to a particular type in robust way is to use 
ref_ptr&lt;&gt; and the readFile&lt;T&gt;(..) method i.e.


     auto model = osgDB::readRefFile&lt;osg::Group&gt;(fileName, dbOptions));  // 
return a ref_ptr&lt;osg::Group&gt; that internally uses an 
dynamic_cast&lt;osg::Group*&gt;



The next odditiyr is that you have a CleanupModel method that removes the 
whole Viewer, but you call it a View:


void OpenSceneGraphBitmap::CleanupModel()

{

       RemoveViews();

...


}


This seems like your application is conflating various different features 
together, which is a red flag by itself and makes me wonder if you have 
mis-understood the intent of the various osgViewer class available.


The new bit of related code is another sign of misuse of the how the OSG is 
intended to be used:


void OpenSceneGraphBitmap::RemoveViews()

{

       if (m_nhiCompositeViewer != nullptr)

       {

              m_nhiCompositeViewer-&gt;setDone(true);

 

              delete m_nhiCompositeViewer;

              m_nhiCompositeViewer = nullptr;

       }


The OSG has built in robust reference counting, it is almost never 
appropriate to directly delete a object, not in the scene graph, not in the 
viewer, not a whole viewer.  I suspect your application at a higher level 
is not ideally organized so the following suggestion might just gloss over 
wider problems, any I say it here as understanding ref_ptr&lt;&gt; usage is 
important regardless...


So your m_nhiCompositeViewer pointer should *always* be a ref_ptr&lt;&gt; and 
*never* a straight C pointer.  If you want to delete a viewer you just set 
the ref_ptr&lt;&gt; to nullptr and it'll be automatically deleted for you if no 
other references exist t it.  The above method could safely be replaced 
with a single line : m_nhiCompositeViewer = nullptr;


However, this doesn't fix the other problems in the code, it'd just fix a 
bad practice.


Next problem will need to look at is back to the OpenSceneGraphBitmap::CleanupModel() 
method:



void OpenSceneGraphBitmap::CleanupModel()

{

       RemoveViews();

 

       if (m_Root != nullptr)     // if root already exists (already loaded 
previous scene) remove children to clean up

       {

              m_Root-&gt;releaseGLObjects();

              m_Root-&gt;removeChildren(0, m_Root-&gt;getNumChildren());

 

              void* ptr = m_Root.release();

              delete ptr;

              m_Root = nullptr;

       }

}


Here you call RemoveViews() which will delete the Viewer and all graphics 
contexts associated with it.  The you try and do some manual clean up:


       if (m_Root != nullptr)     // if root already exists (already loaded 
previous scene) remove children to clean up

       {

              m_Root-&gt;releaseGLObjects();

              m_Root-&gt;removeChildren(0, m_Root-&gt;getNumChildren());


This suggest to me that you are keeping m_Root around as some form of 
global container and then trying to manage it's contents.  The code 
snippets don't say how the node and it's children.  Deleting a Viewer will 
delete all it's GraphicsContext and clean up all the scene graphs that are 
directly attached to it, but it you have scene graph elements that are 
detached from the scene graph then it can't clean up these.  If these 
detached elements contain GL objects will have already been deleted by the 
graphics context deletion, so the handles are orphaned but the OSG itself 
doesn't know about it, and calling releaseGLObjects() will release the 
handles into containers that the OSG uses to schedule deletion or reuse of 
the GL objects.  If the graphics contexts already deleted then you have to 
discard any GL handles via calling discardGLObjects() rather than 
releaseGLObjects().


The osgViewer and scene graph are design to do all the automatic clean up 
and management of GL objects behind the scenes for you, for most 
applications there should never be a need to explicitly call 
releaseGLObjects();  The OSG can't track what you detach from viewers and 
then manipulate, in these cases you really need to think whether what you 
are doing is necessary and sensible.  My strong recommendation is that 
users avoid doing this.  


Finally we have another instance of manually an object:


              void* ptr = m_Root.release();

              delete ptr;

              m_Root = nullptr;


The code tells me that m_Root is likely a ref_ptr&lt;Group&gt; which rather than 
just do the sensible thing and call m_Root = nullptr and let the smart 
pointer do it's job in clean up you release the pointer and then manually 
delete it.


It's painful to see such a combination a misuse of the OSG.  I don't know 
where you have picked up this coding style, but it's never been part of the 
OSG usage, none of the OSG examples, none of books, never in it's near 20 
year history has abusing ref_ptr&lt;&gt; in this way been advocated.  


I don't know the history of your application, it could be that you've 
inherited bad code and have been thrown in the deepened trying to learn and 
fix stuff at the same time.  From this point, I am pretty sure that the 
regression you see in going from 3.6.0 to 3.6.4 is likely to mis-use of the 
OSG in your application code that make it's so fragile and dependent on 
accidental behaviors to function.  Fixing bugs on the OSG then can easily 
break your application as it was relying on buggy behavior.


&gt;<i>From the little snippets I've picked up a number of problems, fixing these 
</I>might work around the problems, but my guess is that there are major 
problem throughout the code.  The good news is that if you learn to use the 
OSG a bit more appropriately your codebase will become smaller, cleaner, 
easier to maintain, more robust, more fun to work with.


Spending a bit of time learning about how smart pointers work and how to 
use them will really help you.  You have accesses to the full OSG source 
code so if you aren't sure about something just have a look at the code, 
put break points into the code, see what happens when smart pointers do 
there thing.  Have a look through the examples, discussions online, have a 
look at the OSG books.  This investment in learning more about the how 
thing work will make you much more productive.


Best of luck,

Robert.
