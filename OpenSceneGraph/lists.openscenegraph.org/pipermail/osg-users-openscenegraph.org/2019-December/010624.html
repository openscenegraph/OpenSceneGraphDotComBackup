The above post wasn't originally from me, but the googlegroup put this post 
from  *&#34081;&#23569;&#27874;* beijihuohu onto another topic due to it being posted as a reply 
to the other thread but without a changed subject....  Folks please just 
post directly to the list if you have a new topic, don't reply and change 
the topic as it breaks threading...

Anyway, w.r.t osgQt, it's now a separate project not maintain by me.  I 
don't personally much Qt expertise so it was never qualified to provide any 
guidance or support on Qt issues - it's why osgQt was spun out.  I'll have 
to defer to Qt OSG users to be able to answer questions like this one.

In principle I can't see why the OSG/osgQt can't by used as a dynamic 
library, because.... err well the OSG has always been built as a lib/dll 
combination.  Perhaps the questions isn't actually about dll's though... 
Perhaps just a Qt specific issue?  Either way I can't provide any input on 
it as right now it doesn't look like general OSG issue that I might have 
expertise on.

Cheers,
Robert.
