<PRE>Hi Greg,

Today I worked on improving the ObectCache::releaseGLObjects() 
implementation so that it removes objects in the scene that are Texture or 
contain Textures in their subgraph, where the Texture no longer have any 
associated osg::Image. I believe this resolves the usage case :

  1.  Load the scene graph, with the Texture UnRefImageAfterApply setiings 
are set to UnrefImageAfterApply, with the loaded textures/scene graphs 
being cached in the osgDB::ObjectCache.
  2. Render the scene graph, resulting the in the scene graph images being 
unref'd from their Textures.
  3. Close the Window, which cleans up the scene graph GL obects by calling 
releaseGLObjects()
  4. Load a new scene graph with textures/objects loaded from disk and 
where possible from the ObjectCache if previously loaded and cache,  Got 
back to 2. (Rendering etc.)

I created an example that follows all these steps and it reproduced the 
problem with the textures appearing black on the second time around when 
loading an OpenFlight database.  With the fixes to 
ObjectCache::releaseGLObjects() the unref'd images are automatically 
removed from the cache as part of step 3. above, so that they aren't shared 
any more, instead new copies are loaded from disk with their image in place.

This fix is checked into the OpenSceneGraph-3.6 branch.  The commit is:

    
<A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/commit/9ae47b921b2184788e6efe85692908bd0ba900a2">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/commit/9ae47b921b2184788e6efe85692908bd0ba900a2</A>

Could you please test this out.  You should be able to remove your own 
manually clearing of the ObjectCache now, as it will be done automatically 
when required.

Cheers,
Robert.
