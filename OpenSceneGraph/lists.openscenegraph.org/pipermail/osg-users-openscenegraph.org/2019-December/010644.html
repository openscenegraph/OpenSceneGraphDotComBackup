Given the fickle nature of threading problems, just because it occurs in 
3.6.x but not 3.4.x doesn't mean that there has been a bug introduced after 
3.4, it just needs some condition to slightly change that cause some of the 
data in the application to be aligned different and over the application 
goes.

The best I can recommend is to run the application with valgrind 
--tool=helgrind to see if it picks up any race conditions.

</I><A HREF="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexStorage2D.xhtml">https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexStorage2D.xhtml</A>

Errors

GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated by glTexStorage2D if zero is bound to 
target.

GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated by glTextureStorage2D if texture is not 
the name of an existing texture object.

GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if internalformat is not a valid sized 
internal format.

GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target or the effective target of texture 
is not one of the accepted targets described above.

GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if width, height or levels are less than 1.

GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if target is GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY or 
GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY and levels is greater than &#8970;log2(width)&#8971;+1

GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if target is not GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY or 
GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY and levels is greater than &#8970;log2(max(width, 
height))&#8971;+1

Given the glTexStorage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_RGB8, 320, 320) looks valid 
on it's own we are left with:

GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated by glTexStorage2D if zero is bound to 
target.

The next step would be to put into some test code that Texture2D.cpp to 
track what is happening right before the call.  There is a 
textureObject-&gt;bind() before each call to glTexStorage2D, but perhaps this 
is failing for some reason.

        GLenum texStorageSizedInternalFormat = 
extensions-&gt;isTextureStorageEnabled &amp;&amp; (_borderWidth==0) ? 
selectSizedInternalFormat() : 0;
         if (texStorageSizedInternalFormat!=0)
         {
             textureObject = generateAndAssignTextureObject(contextID, 
GL_TEXTURE_2D, _numMipmapLevels, texStorageSizedInternalFormat, 
_textureWidth, _textureHeight, 1, _borderWidth);
             textureObject-&gt;bind();
             applyTexParameters(GL_TEXTURE_2D, state);
             extensions-&gt;glTexStorage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D, 
osg::maximum(_numMipmapLevels,1), texStorageSizedInternalFormat,
                      _textureWidth, _textureHeight);
         }
         else
         {
             GLenum internalFormat = _sourceFormat ? _sourceFormat : 
_internalFormat;
             textureObject = generateAndAssignTextureObject(contextID, 
GL_TEXTURE_2D, _numMipmapLevels, internalFormat, _textureWidth, 
_textureHeight, 1, _borderWidth);
             textureObject-&gt;bind();
             applyTexParameters(GL_TEXTURE_2D, state);
             glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, _internalFormat,
                      _textureWidth, _textureHeight, _borderWidth,
                      internalFormat,
                      _sourceType ? _sourceType : GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,
                      0);
        }

I can't investigate either issue without being able to recreate the 
crash/GL errors myself. If either of these issues occur on an existing OSG 
example then I can take it from there.

Short of being able to recreate the issue and investigate it myself the 
only thing I can do is suggest ways of investigating the issue that might 
reveal the cause of the issues.

Cheers,
Robert.
