<PRE>Hi.

You may have a look at the problem from a different angle. If someone
is stealing from you that means they need it. If you cannot stop it
(or it costs much more than simply let them have it), then you should
lead it. Instead of hiding your great shaders you can publish them
yourself (don't forget to add some notes about your company in the
comments)! This would be the marketing way of handling the problem.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know what the OSG solution to this would be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could obfuscate the shader code. Though to be honest this would only slow someone down not stop them from obtaining the shader source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to obfusication put the shader source into the DLL/exe and potentially hide the strings by a simple rotation or masking of the data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could add additional logic to detect OpenGL/GPU debuggers and/or check the OpenGL shared library is loaded from sensible locations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other options would be to look at the following in OpenGL. I've not used either of them so they may not work particularly well.

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glShaderBinary.xhtml">https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glShaderBinary.xhtml</A> (OpenGL 4.1)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may find that the SPIRV extension is not widely supported yet on all GPUs and drivers (mesa support is not yet there) that your customers are using. SPIRV modules are an intermediate compiled representation of the shaders so someone with a lot of time could reverse engineer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The shader binary I believe may be limited to the GPU/driver that it was compiled for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also OSG would need to be modified to use SPIRV or shader binaries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of this is a trade off between cost of implementation, additional test and support costs and lost revenue.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Robert, dear community,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I use OSG since many years now with great success. But being honest I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is mainly one really weak part, the shaders we develop.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We spent years now in very complex and highly optimized shaders and I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My question: Is there any way solving this problem? Is there any driver

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this feature missing in general or is it just not in the OSG api?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If all the questions are answered NO can anybody provide a contact to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many thanks in advance for any hints and help.
