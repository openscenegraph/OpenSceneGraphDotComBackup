&gt;<i> Hi Richard,

</I>This is following on from my (somewhat lengthy) message[1] on 
2019-01-08, 00:15Z which has context at the start of that message, but 
for ease of reading it is as below.

 &gt;Using osg master; self built; application FlightGear; Win32 x64; MSVC 
2015.
 &gt;In FlightGear when OSG warning Warning: deleting still referenced 
object ... the final reference count was&quot; is detected in our 
NotifyHandler we throw an exception (probably the only reliably thing to 
do, as this message generally comes before some sort of segfault).

I appreciate that when viewed out of context the recent message makes no 
sense as it's about my testing of the changes I've made to ObjectCache 
and DatabasePage to use a ReadWriteMutex to ensure that nothing is 
removed from the cache when the DatabasePager thread is in the process 
of adding a new model that references something in the object cache that 
has just expired.

The test is currently at 54.2 hours of flight time - and some 
perfunctory checks in the debugger show that the cache is being 
maintained (objects are expiring); and the message[2] &quot;...cannot check 
for expiry as something is accessing the object cache&quot; indicates that 
the object cache mutext check is working properly (the check uses 
tryLock so rendering performance isn't affected).

I'm still working on my assumption that my original analysis[1] is right 
and it is probably best viewed on the forum as the formatting wasn't 
nice when I posted to the list and I've since cleaned up the forum version.

[2] I added the debug message &quot;cannot check for expiry as something is 
accessing the object cache&quot; to indicate that the object cache was 
waiting (tryLock) on the mutex
