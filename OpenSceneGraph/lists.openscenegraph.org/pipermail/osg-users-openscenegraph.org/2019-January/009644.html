<PRE>Hi Robert;


&gt;<i> As a general comment, if you could use the OpenSceneGraph-3.6 branch
</I>I'm still using 3.7 - I'll switch over to 3.6 soon; although it's a bit 
tedious because I have to rebuild everything and it takes a good few hours.

&gt;<i> base to work from.  I'd also recommend checking the whole model
</I>&gt;<i> loading/processing path to make sure all the methods are taking and
</I>I did this by setting breakpoints on the non Ref methods in object cache 
and this lead me straight to the problem (my incredlible idoicy) - in 
that I failed to merge in your changes in the version I committed (i.e. 
the fix to simgear I've committed doesn't include the fix to 
DefaultCachePolicy::find). So the version I started testing on Sunday 
(after committing) failed; whereas the versions I was testing all last 
week are fine.

So almost certainly my report is incorrect and it's working fine; which 
is a relief and I apologise for wasting your time.

I will verify the other methods. I don't think optimise is important 
because it's working with an already loaded model which I think has come 
from a ReadResult; but I'll check this.

--Richard
