<PRE>Hi,

I don't know what the OSG solution to this would be.

You could obfuscate the shader code. Though to be honest this would only
slow someone down not stop them from obtaining the shader source.

In addition to obfusication put the shader source into the DLL/exe and
potentially hide the strings by a simple rotation or masking of the data.

You could add additional logic to detect OpenGL/GPU debuggers and/or check
the OpenGL shared library is loaded from sensible locations.

The other options would be to look at the following in OpenGL. I've not
used either of them so they may not work particularly well.

   - <A HREF="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_gl_spirv.txt">https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_gl_spirv.txt</A>
   (OpenGL 4.6)
   -
   <A HREF="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glShaderBinary.xhtml">https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glShaderBinary.xhtml</A>
   (OpenGL 4.1)

You may find that the SPIRV extension is not widely supported yet on all
GPUs and drivers (mesa support is not yet there) that your customers are
using. SPIRV modules are an intermediate compiled representation of the
shaders so someone with a lot of time could reverse engineer.

The shader binary I believe may be limited to the GPU/driver that it was
compiled for.

Also OSG would need to be modified to use SPIRV or shader binaries.

Most of this is a trade off between cost of implementation, additional test
and support costs and lost revenue.

Regards
Damian
