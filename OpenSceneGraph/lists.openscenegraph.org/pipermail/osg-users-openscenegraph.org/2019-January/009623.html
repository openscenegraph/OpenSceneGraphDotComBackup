The Issue code your wrote is a mess of bad programming practices.  How
would we know where a problem is when the Issue code has so many
problems of it's own.  Should these be fixed first?  Would the problem
still exist once they are fixed?

The PR is idiotic.  Changing a osg::State pointer to the current VAS
just because there is a &quot;chance&quot; that a VAS might be the same one as
one that is deleted and invalidate it is just crazy .  It's such a
bad &quot;solution&quot; I can't believe that you asking for a public correction
of it.   To see how silly it is just think how often you &quot;fix&quot; would
call the same reset of the osg::Sate::CurrentVertexArrayState() when
you have multiple VAS that need deleting.  If we had a 1000 to delete
then it's call reset 1000 times and even then not one of these 1000
might not be the same as the CurrentVertexArrayState().

I'm not rejecting these PR's out of spite, they simply aren't good
fixes, they are hacks.

Robert.
