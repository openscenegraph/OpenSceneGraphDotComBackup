<PRE>Hi All,

I have merged enough fixes that address some issues found in 3.6.3 to
warrant pushing forward towards a 3.6.4 stable maintainance release.
First step on the way is 3.6.4 release candidate 1:

    <A HREF="https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.6.4-rc1">https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/tree/OpenSceneGraph-3.6.4-rc1</A>

Fingers crossed the 3.6 branch that this was tagged from is a good
state and will compile and run fine across all platforms.  Only way to
find out for sure is community testing, so for the first time in 2019
I have to say:

  Please test, release quality depends upon it :-)

Once it looks like the rc's are working well across all platforms I'll
tag the 3.6.4 stable release, hopefully in the next two weeks.

Cheers,
Robert.

Restructured the clean up of arrays/primitives and GL objects

Mon, 31 Dec 2018 11:06:45 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Changed the clean up of the GL objects on destruction so that the
destructors of the arrays/primitives themselves do the release rather
than have it done explictly in the destructor.  This allows
arrays/primitives to be shared.

Prefer FOURCC pixel format in DDS loaderI have found that certain
image editing programs export DDS images with both the DDPF_FOURCC and
DDPF_RGB pixel format flags. The DDS loader will give preference to
the DDPF_RGB flag and try to deduce the format from the RGB bit mask
values instead of using the more reliable FOURCC flag. This causes
some images to not load, even though the FOURCC flag is supported.
I've modified the loader so that it checks for the DDPF_FOURCC flag
first, then falls back on deducing the format from the RGB bit masks.

Fix handling of alpha values in animated gifsThe gif loader was
incorrectly setting pixels as transparent in certain animated gifs. It
was ignoring the disposal method value in the extension block and
always overwriting the alpha value in each frame. It is common for
some animated gifs to set the disposal method so that the previous
alpha value is retained. This patch modifies the loader to respect the
disposal method flag.

osgDB::OutputStream write array optimizationI've made a change to
osgDB::OutputStream::writeArrayImplementation so that it writes the
array data in a single write operation for binary files. This
significantly speeds up writing out osgb files for large data sets
(e.g. point clouds). osgDB::InputStream already performs a similar
optimization when reading array data from binary files.

Fix hardware mipmap generation for cube mapsI was getting a black
image when enabling hardware mipmap generation on cubemaps. I believe
the problem is that the base Texture class is hard coding
GL_TEXTURE_2D when enabling mipmap generation, instead of using the
target type from the derived class.
