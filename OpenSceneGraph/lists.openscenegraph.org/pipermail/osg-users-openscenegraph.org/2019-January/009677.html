<PRE>Dear Trajce,

do you have any idea how incomplete is your answer? There's no point in knowing the function if I don't know how to set its parameters correctly.

What everybody learning OSG need is &quot;a simple source code showing how it's done&quot;, and this means a few lines of code, not less than a single line. Please.
