<PRE>I want to change the camera direction with the mouse, and position with the keyboard. I've found an example on how to change the position, but still couldn't find anything explaining how to change the direction (and not sure if the position will change correctly when the direction changes). All I find is &quot;take a look at the manipulator source code, it will give inspiration&quot; etc. But I just don't get how can I implement that from the source code I saw.

Considering this is such a trivial task, why is it virtually impossible to find a simple source code showing how it's done?

Thanks,
Rodrigo
