<PRE>HI Richard,

</I>
This month I'm working towards a 3.6.4 stable release, given that an
issue has been observed between 3.4.x and master there is reasonable
chance that it also exists in the 3.6 branch, so it would be good to
track down what is going on.

In the 3.6 release cycle we did track down some bugs related to the
object cache, the fixes should have made it into master.  I would be
worth checking the log for src/osgDB/ObjectCache.cpp for 3.4, 3.6 and
master to see if there is anything that needs to be ported between
these branches,

If you are able to characterise what is going on then let me know and
I may be able to help spot a solution.  Having a small example that
reproduces the problem would be ideal as this could then be used to
figure out the cause and confirm that it's finally fixed.

Cheers,
Robert.
