<PRE>HI Chris,

I'm not saying that at all.

The limitation with the current design+implementation is you hold a global
reference to a scene graph object to prevent it from getting deleted
normally as it's hidden from the viewers that manage the graphics contexts.
For those objects you have to explictly call releaseGLObjects() as it won't
happen for you.

Now, if this mechanism isn't working for a particular non standard usage
case then it could be that the above extra house keeping isn't being done
correctly, or there's an underlying OSG bug that needs to be addressed.

At this point I think it's pointless trying to explain yet again as that &quot;I
don't really understand what you mean&quot;, I've read what you've written
multiple times tried my best and given you my best answer.  The best way to
sort out this type of issue is by creating an example that illustrates the
problem usage case.  The one you've posted has problems that I raised,
these would need fixing before taking the next step and looking to whether
there is an OSG bug.

It's also important to test against OSG-3.6 branch/master as well as
whatever other versions you are building against.  There was a bug in
handle osgText in 3.4.x that was addressed in 3.6.x.

Cheers.
Robert.
