<PRE>Hi Chris,

I have already added a
osgDB::Registry::instance()-&gt;releaseGLObjects(state); to the
osgViewer::Renader::releaseGLObjects():


void Renderer::releaseGLObjects(osg::State* state) const
{
    osgDB::Registry::instance()-&gt;releaseGLObjects(state);

    if (_sceneView[0].valid()) _sceneView[0]-&gt;releaseGLObjects(state);
    if (_sceneView[1].valid()) _sceneView[1]-&gt;releaseGLObjects(state);
}

This is in master and the 3.6 branch.  This should clear the ObjectCache.
It's why I added this.

I can't keep running around in circles on this.  I've put in a lot of
effort to try and resolve what I can, but now I need to get on with other
work.

Robert.
