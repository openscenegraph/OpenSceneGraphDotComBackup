I think it was back working after a bit offline while I was away on
holiday, hadn't checked it recently (I don't admin the forum), checking
this morning it's offline again.

As a workaround for the above issue, and as I don't have any role in
management of the forum I took over admin of the osg-users googlegroups
mirror and enable it's use as a forum, though as the forum came backonline
I didn't announce it:

     <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osg-users">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osg-users</A>

So perhaps it's time to just default to the googlegroup.

Just how many PrimitiveSet are you using?  It has to be pretty extreme to
cause performance issues when creating the scene.

My guess is that this slow down in creating the model is could be thought
of as a canary in the coal mine. OpenGL and modern hardware really don't
like being passed primitive data in small chunks, it's a huge performance
bottleneck having large number of small bottlenecks.

You will for sure get better performance when creating and rendering your
scene once you starting using a small number of primitive sets with a large
number of primitives.
