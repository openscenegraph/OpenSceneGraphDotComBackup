<PRE>I have a few questions about how to build a driver to do some specific tasks in osgEarth.

Simple example.
Using simple ocean as an example replace the texture piece with geo-spacial image and then build a shader to add effect to the image.
Ie. Arrowed line that changes color in towards the direction a path should be followed start to end.

The shader piece can be figured out by us working with the shader code.

The part I am having issues with is adding an arrow image or geometry polygon of an arrow to the map at the position I need it at to run the shader effect on.

Is this the correct place to aske this sort of question or is there a different mailing list or thread I should use to get help with getting this designed.

Thank you in advance
