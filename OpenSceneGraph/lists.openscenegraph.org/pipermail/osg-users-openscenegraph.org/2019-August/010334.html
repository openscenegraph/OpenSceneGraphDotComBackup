<PRE>Hi Chris,

As far as I'm aware the issues you have are pretty unusual, in most usage
cases the OSG looks to be doing the right thing, it's niche usage cases
that are the issue.  I've tried to help plug the gaps with the usage cases
you've come up with, but can't do anymore without concrete usage cases to
study that illustrate in runnable code the problem you have, trying to
parse explanations for this type of thing is fraught with problems - what
might be clear in your head but you have a whole bunch of extra information
relevant to your application that I don't have.  I have lots of different
topics that need my attention so I have to jump between, each one I have to
try to get up to speed and work out what is going on, having threads that
meander across months of posts makes this whole process even harder to
follow.

Concrete code cuts through it all, a succinct example that I can read work
out what is going on, run it, see the problem first hand, then apply and
fix and confirm that it fixes it.  It's the gold standard way to get things
resolved.

Looks like a hack that would be workaround for a specific usage case not a
general solution.

Robert.
