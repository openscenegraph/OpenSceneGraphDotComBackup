&gt;<i> For a bigger research project, i need to develop a first person driving simulator - or in other words, a framework supporting driving simulation. It should be like a customizable racing game which connects to a real life test bench for car physics, a motion platform as well as different input and visualization devices
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For this i need a very realistic environment (buildings, trees, traffic participants, rain, wind...) as well as a simple scenario editor. The editor should allow an easy configuration of maps and support certain triggers. A basic physics engine is also required but it does not need to be very sophisticated bc I'm going to use parameters from the real-life test bench.
</I>&gt;<i>

OSG would certainly work, however OSG is only a scene graph. It
doesn't have a pipeline for producing assets, no scenario/scene
editor, no concept of a &quot;map&quot;, no scripting/triggers, etc. You would
have to implement/intergrate all that yourself - OSG is basically
&quot;only&quot; OpenGL with a lot of convenience functions.

What you are likely looking for is a complete game engine instead. If
you want to use OSG, there is Delta3D which is OSG based and
integrates some of the above already.

Regards,

Jan
