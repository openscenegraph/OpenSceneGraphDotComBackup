<PRE>Hi all,

thanks for your suggestion. 

@Jan Ciger
I had a look into Delta3D. However I have a bad feeling about it. The development is not very active, so is the support/community. But it is a very good inspiration for possible features and architectures. Thanks for that!

@Per Nordqvist
Thanks for letting me know that! I'm very interest in the driving simulator of Volvo, maybe you could direct me to some more information with included features or something like that? ^^ Also thanks for the hints on some possible tools and model suppliers!

@bbjorn
I totally agree with you. Delta3D seemed to be a good alternative with the existing tools. However, as mentioned before, it doesn't make a good expression. Unfortunately, renting or off-the-shelf platforms are not an solution because of the research character of our project (and the limited amount of money ^^). But thanks for the tip. I certainly will contact you regarding your framework :)

FYI: 
Right now, it looks like I'll use a) Unreal Engine, b) Unity Engine or c) an in-house pbr graphics engine focused. The first and second have a nice feature set, but aren't open source. the last is open source but lacks necessary features (yay. coding ahead ^^). However, I like the idea and concepts of open scene graph and will try to integrate my solutions (which are targeted to new user interfaces) with osg in my free time. So be prepared to hear more from me :)

bye.
