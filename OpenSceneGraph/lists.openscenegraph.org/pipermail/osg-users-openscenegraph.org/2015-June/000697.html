Generally speaking, you can't. 3DS Max (or Maya or Blender ...) uses a
very different shading and lighting model than OSG (or any 3D engine).
This must be converted by the exporter plugin and even then the
conversion is never 1:1 because some things simply don't have an
equivalent representation, e.g. various normal mapping, composition
effects, shaders, etc.

This is a common and non OSG-specific problem. The asset creation
pipeline is a huge issue for any 3D engine and generally the asset
tools are written from scratch for each, to support their needs. It is
a large industry and the market for these tools is where a lot of
money is being made - good tools are rare and expensive. Then your 3D
designer needs to be aware of the limitations of both the 3D engine
they are targetting and the exporters and create their model
accordingly.

If you are hoping to download a random model somewhere and use it with
OSG/Unreal/Unity/etc. without any changes/rework, that is bound to
fail, unfortunately. At best you get the mesh and some materials
(vertex colors and some textures), at worst not even the mesh.

Good luck,

J.
