<PRE>Hey,

how are you? At first, thanks for the effort put in the development of OpenSceneGraph.
For a bigger research project, i need to develop a first person driving simulator - or in other words, a framework supporting driving simulation. It should be like a customizable racing game which connects to a real life test bench for car physics, a motion platform as well as different input and visualization devices

For this i need a very realistic environment (buildings, trees, traffic participants, rain, wind...) as well as a simple scenario editor. The editor should allow an easy configuration of maps and support certain triggers. A basic physics engine is also required but it does not need to be very sophisticated bc I'm going to use parameters from the real-life test bench.

Currently, I'm looking for a nice open source engine which makes the development a little bit easier through having some built-in features.
&gt;<i>From the wiki and the forum I got the idea that OpenSceneGraph might be a good choice bc of it's openness, basic structure and the extensibility. Now i want to ask you, if anyone has some feedback for me?
</I>Is OpenSceneGraph be the right choice? Or do you suggest using another engine? (I'm especially concerned about the graphics. Is OpenSceneGraph suitable or fast enough?)

Of course, all results of my research will be published and open source as well :)
Any feedback is welcome!
Thx in advance!

Cheers,
Florian
