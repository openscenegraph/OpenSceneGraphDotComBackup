Please be aware that OSVR is not really the HMD (HDK) - the much
larger part is the software framework to manage the VR hardware for
you application (even if you are not using the HDK).

The HDK itself has some interesting features that no other consumer
HMD on the market has, though. Display resolution is not the main
thing there, even though it should be comparable to Rift DK2.

For me the key differentiator is the built-in FPGA for image
processing. That could do things like the image distortion and colour
aberration correction in hardware, without the application needing to
be aware of it all. The application feeds it a regular side-by-side or
frame sequential signal and the FPGA would do all the work that
currently has to be hacked in through shaders or the late image
warping used by Rift for reducing the tracking latency. Basically that
would make integration of such HMD very trivial, not requiring
specific support from Nvidia or a proprietary SDK where you are at the
mercy of the driver vendor because everything is done by your PC. You
could  even connect the thing to your Bluray player or a Playstation
and play 3D movies on it directly, without any special software
support. Good luck trying to do something like that with the Rift ...


The FPGA firmware for this isn't available yet, but the hardware is in
place and is documented - they are a bit hoping that some 3rdparty
hacker will sit down and write the necessary Verilog for this, based
on the recent blog post.

Regards,

J.
