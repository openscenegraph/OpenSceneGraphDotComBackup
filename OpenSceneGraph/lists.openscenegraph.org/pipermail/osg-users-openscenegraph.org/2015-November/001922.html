<PRE>Hi Kouichi,

In general I would discourage use of compile contexts except for very
narrow usage models.  The main issue comes down to shadred contexts having
the potential for conflicts when reading/writing to shared GL objects.  The
OSG doesn't have mutexes built into access of GL objects so can only do
shared context/compile context if no GL objects will be accessed by the two
contexts concurrently.  Adding such mutexes would add a huge burden on all
OSG applications.

Robert.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, in 2014 he seems to be discouraging their use, maybe due to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The OSG's is written to handling multi-theading of shared contexts as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handling this special case would require us to add lots of mutex locks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to all OpenGL code that is setting or using OpenGL objects.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's better to avoid shared contexts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Inspecting the source code, of particular concern to me is the
</I>&gt;<i> creation/deletion of GL objects.  It appears that the GL object orphan list
</I>&gt;<i> is accessed without mutual exclusion, from the flush functions as well as
</I>&gt;<i> the orphan reuse functions during object creation.  Therefore these two
</I>&gt;<i> operations must then never be performed in different threads, but if they
</I>&gt;<i> are only called from the same thread (the compile context thread in my
</I>&gt;<i> case) is thread safety then guaranteed?  I would be very grateful for
</I>&gt;<i> clarifications regarding this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you!
