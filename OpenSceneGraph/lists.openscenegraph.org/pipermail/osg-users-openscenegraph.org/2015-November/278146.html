<PRE>Hi developers,

I am very new to the openscenegraph programming and needed to use osg for some development. The current task is fairly simple as mentioned in the Subject. But I encounter a problem which is after the conversion, the osganimationviewer cannot play the converted animation. The viewer can play fbx with animation without any problem, but playing the converted file(.osg extension) would miss out all the animation(meanwhile the texture are correctly loaded.)

I must admit I have very little knowledge on 3D programming and I would like to know more about how to &quot;hack&quot; the openscenegraph engine. I would also appreciate any good reference that would lead me learning how to build a 3D engine or know more about how to code the OSG engine, because I can't find much documentation in the OpenSceneGraph website.(I can't even find the specification for .osg extension to solve the problem I am dealing with).

When I was trying to converting different FBX files(or even loading various files), I found that some of the files are not correctly loaded like missing textures, missing animations, etc. I would like to know if there are any documentations describing the limits of osgviewer/osganimationviewer/osgconv programs because I am feeling like I am working with a black box and guessing their(the aforementioned programs) behaviour. It's more like doing reverse engineering and I feel frustrating and it's not like learning programming :( . Well, I could be the reason I possess too little relavent knowledge and would anyone suggest some good source explaining the compatibility of FBX and OSG files?

Thank you very much for your time!

Cheers,
Gabriel :'  :'  :'
