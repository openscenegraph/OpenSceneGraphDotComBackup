<PRE>Hi,

You don't really need an OSVR HDK to test this. It should work even
with Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2, Vrvana's Totem and, of course, the
Sensics HMDs (dSight and such). They ship example descriptors for
these.

Basically what OSVR manages for you is mainly the display
configuration - things like what are the distortion parameters, IPD,
focal distance, resolution, etc.

I am not sure whether or not there are plugins written to initialize
the individual HMDs and handle their built-in trackers - I am sure
there is one for the OSVR HDK, but I haven't seen ones for the other
HMDs. If there isn't one already (I didn't really look), it wouldn't
be too hard to write one, though, using the official Rift SDK.

Correction: Of course that there is one:
