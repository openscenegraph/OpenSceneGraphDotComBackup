I see what you mean, but the problem is that I'm already doing the above suggestions and my performance is still far from acceptable so something needs to be done. Using a separate thread for GPU transfers will enable what Nvidia calls a &quot;copy engine&quot; that can transfer data in parallel with the rendering, something otherwise not possible. This could potentially provide a huge benefit for my application since it is heavy on both rendering and GPU transfers, so I will try to experiment with making it work. So far it's looking very promising.

Many thanks,
Kouichi
