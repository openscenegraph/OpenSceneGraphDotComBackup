Hi Jan,

Thanks again for sharing your thoughts on the subject. :)

 &gt;&gt; My original motivation was to move to using &quot;modern&quot; OpenGL (ie. 
avoiding
 &gt;&gt; anything deprecated) because I didn't want to be in the situation 
where I
 &gt;&gt; started relying on something that was likely to be removed in the 
future.
 &gt;
 &gt; Well, I don't think you need to worry about that too much.

Yeah, I'm pretty-much past this one now. :)

 &gt; Yes, the
 &gt; &quot;old school&quot; OpenGL is marked as deprecated and removed from the Core
 &gt; profiles (and OpenGL ES 2.0 doesn't support it at all). However, at
 &gt; least Nvidia (AMD/Ati probably as well) has declared that they are
 &gt; going to support the legacy profiles for indefinite future.
 &gt;
 &gt; The reason is that the code is already in the driver and costs them
 &gt; essentially nothing (the old APIs don't change) and also the ton of
 &gt; old code that uses it. That's also why the OpenGL 3 was felt to be
 &gt; such a letdown and not a radical departure in a new direction - there
 &gt; are simply too many CAD and visualization companies with decades old
 &gt; codebases that would stop working overnight with a new driver and
 &gt; there is no business willpower to rewrite that because it works well
 &gt; enough. Moreover, I am pretty sure that even today you will find major
 &gt; CAD systems doing atrocities such as using direct mode (glBegin/glEnd)
 &gt; somewhere in their code ...

That certainly makes sense. I had wondered at the time how successful 
the deprecation would be. I could see it being successful if a popular 
compatibility layer library emerged and gained widespread use, but I 
don't think this really happened. This seems to mean that the bulk of 
the compatibility support is instead retained at the driver level, which 
is as you note.

 &gt;&gt; Additionally, I have a need that I know is not going to be handled 
very well
 &gt;&gt; in the fixed-function pipeline. From experience I know that whilst 
the FFP
 &gt;&gt; is neat for simpler tasks, it feels like a massive burden as the 
needs get
 &gt;&gt; more complex.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; A last goal was as a learning exercise. The aim was to rely on shader
 &gt;&gt; functionality a bit more strictly than minimally necessary, as a 
means of
 &gt;&gt; taking care of the glaring (and increasingly hard-to-explain 
professionally)
 &gt;&gt; hole in my 3D knowledge.
 &gt;
 &gt; By all means, that is a good reason. Also if you decide to develop on
 &gt; mobile, you won't have much choice there.

Yes, this is much clearer to me know.

As a side note, I have to say that I am really liking the ability to 
hang Uniforms off arbitrary parts of the scene graph- generally on 
Geometry or Groups depending on the scope that I need the Uniform to 
cover. It's really a very nice design.

Thanks again!

Cheers,
Garth
