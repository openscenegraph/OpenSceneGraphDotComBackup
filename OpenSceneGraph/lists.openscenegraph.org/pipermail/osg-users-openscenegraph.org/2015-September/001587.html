Hi Christian,

Many thanks for the interesting suggestion. :)

My main development environment is Linux-based, with a secondary 
virtualised Windows development environment. Due to the visualization 
(VirtualBox) I don't believe I can do much in the way of development 
with ANGLE due to its DX backend, at least with my current setup.

Having said that, being able to limit a future port to the OpenGL ES 2.0 
API subset could be very useful indeed. It is likely that I would be 
looking at the feasibility of moving the project I am working on to 
mobile devices in the future, and this sounds like something that could 
be very useful to use while I am doing so.

Cheers,
Garth

 &gt; There would also be plenty of books about OpenGL ES 2.0 available - 
and you

 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Hi all,
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; I was wondering if anyone can make some suggestions as to resources that
 &gt;&gt; are useful for learning GLSL in modern OpenGL (say, 3.0+) with a 
specific
 &gt;&gt; focus on use with OSG.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; My existing GLSL knowledge is weak compared to my general 3D knowledge,
 &gt;&gt; and mostly dates back to the early days of shaders. A lot of what I have
 &gt;&gt; personally done with OpenGL and OSG has involved the fixed-function
 &gt;&gt; pipeline, or things that map to it fairly closely.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Thus far I've been digging around online for GLSL resources, but tend to
 &gt;&gt; frequently find myself doing it the wrong way as I'm using features that
 &gt;&gt; have since become deprecated. On the OSG side I tend to dig around 
in the
 &gt;&gt; OSG examples and search the source to try to find the OSG equivalents to
 &gt;&gt; OpenGL calls I see mentioned in the GLSL resources. I then put these
 &gt;&gt; together and if I'm lucky something useful comes out. :)
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; I think I'll figure things out eventually if I continue to crash around
 &gt;&gt; blindly as I have been, but if anyone can suggest some better starting
 &gt;&gt; points for GLSL use in OSG specifically, it would be much 
appreciated. :)
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Cheers,
 &gt;&gt; Garth
