The cmake variables are meant to be set by the developer, see the
instructions here:

It is possible that GL3 support is still available on Windows only,
but even if that is the case, it shouldn't be terribly difficult to
make it work in Linux too. The drivers and OpenGL implementations
certainly support it now.

Well, it depends on what you want to do. Moving to the &quot;modern&quot; OpenGL
without the fixed pipeline functionality is a big jump, because
basically you don't have anything pre-defined by the library anymore.
No matrix stack (glPush/glPop), everything needs to be managed using
shaders, etc. The older functionality is easier to make display
something on the screen quickly, because there are fewer things to set
up. The newer stuff gives you much more flexibility, though. Using OSG
helps to hide this complexity, because OSG abstracts and manages many
of these things for you, regardless of which OpenGL profile are you
using.
