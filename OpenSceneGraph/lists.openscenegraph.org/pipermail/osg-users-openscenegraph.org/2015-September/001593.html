<PRE>Robert

I'd agree that I'm dealing with a driver bug.  I'm just not sure what the bug is.  I think we are working in a underspecified area of OpenGL when dealing with mipmap levels smaller than the compression block size.  However, I know that my driver generates 2x2 and 1x1 mipmaps for hardware generated compressed textures and this would suggest that it should happily work with these levels.

I don't agree that it is unrelated to the OSX driver issue.  Certainly the drivers are different and the symptoms may be different.  But they both appear to touch the same question; what happens with mipmaps smaller than the block size.  I don't have access to an OSX machine however, so I cannot investigate this claim further.

I have not tried different driver/hardware/OS combinations.  I'd agree that this would be useful, but I'm somewhat limited in how far I can go with this.

I'd agree that a change to the core OSG is not warranted at this time.  The models that cause the problem are not distributable.  I may continue to try and create a model that has the issue as time permits. 

Scott
