Replying to myself with what I have managed to figure out so far to 
provide some information in case it comes up in a search. I can't vouch 
for the accuracy as this is still new to me. Anyway:

- Compile messages end up being sent through the osg::NotifyHandler 
mechanism.

- Shaders don't appear to be compiled immediately, but if you use them 
(by attaching an osg::Program to a osg::StateSet with 
setAttributeAndModes()), they end up being compiled and used at a later 
point.

- osg::StateSet::addUniform() with a osg::Uniform argument seems to be 
the way to specify uniforms.

- osg::Program::addBindAttribLocation() is a means of binding variables 
to a specific attribute index (output location), which you need for 
other calls. I believe location layout qualifiers in the shaders 
themselves can be used as well.

- osg::Program::getAttribBindingList() seems to only return the 
variables set with addBindAttribLocation(), and not ones specified in 
the shader itself. This might be a timing issue, perhaps the results 
change after the shaders are actually compiled and linked?

- osg::State::setUseModelViewAndProjectUniforms(true) can be used to 
automatically hook up variables such as &quot;osg_ModelViewProjectionMatrix&quot;, 
which seems to be an OSG analogue to  &quot;gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix&quot;. 
This seems to be a useful bridge while trying to figure things out.

- The compile messages can be used to confirm the actual attribute 
indexes used.

- Variables that aren't used may be optimised out, which makes them 
unavailable.

- Using Geometry::setVertexAttribArray with the last argument set 
correctly (eg. BIND_PER_VERTEX) seems to be the way that you can pass 
texture coordinates to shaders. I'm guessing other information such as 
vertices and normals are handled similarly.

Hopefully this helps someone in a similar situation to the one I was in.
