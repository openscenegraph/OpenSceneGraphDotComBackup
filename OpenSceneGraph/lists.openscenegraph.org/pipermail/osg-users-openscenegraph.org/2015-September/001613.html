Hi Jan,

Many thanks for the additional information. :)

Thanks. I thought this might be the case.

</I>&gt;<i> Well, it depends on what you want to do. Moving to the &quot;modern&quot; OpenGL

Excellent, many thanks for the explanation and clarification.

My original motivation was to move to using &quot;modern&quot; OpenGL (ie. 
avoiding anything deprecated) because I didn't want to be in the 
situation where I started relying on something that was likely to be 
removed in the future.

Additionally, I have a need that I know is not going to be handled very 
well in the fixed-function pipeline. From experience I know that whilst 
the FFP is neat for simpler tasks, it feels like a massive burden as the 
needs get more complex.

A last goal was as a learning exercise. The aim was to rely on shader 
functionality a bit more strictly than minimally necessary, as a means 
of taking care of the glaring (and increasingly hard-to-explain 
professionally) hole in my 3D knowledge.

As I've been digging around the first goal seems less and less 
important, so my goals have been shifting somewhat. Going pure non-FFP 
is something I can handle down the track.

 &gt; Using OSG
 &gt; helps to hide this complexity, because OSG abstracts and manages many
 &gt; of these things for you, regardless of which OpenGL profile are you
 &gt; using.

Excellent. I couldn't tell if this was the case, or if OpenGL 3+ was an 
experimental thing in OSG, or how complete the OSG support for it was.

At this point I've made it over the initial hurdle of setting things up 
properly in OSG and getting the basics running, so I'm on to the meat of 
the task at this point- messing about with the shaders themselves.

Thanks for taking the time to write that up, it has clarified things 
considerably. Much appreciated. :)

Cheers,
Garth
