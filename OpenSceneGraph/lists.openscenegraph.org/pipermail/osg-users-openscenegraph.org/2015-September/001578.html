<PRE>Hi Scott,

The compression code has been in place quite some while so I'm surprised to
see a report of problem now.  Did this work with previous drivers/OSG
versions/different hardware?

Could you provide a small example and explanation of how to reproduce it so
others can see if they can reproduce the problem?

Thanks,
Robert.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My limited knowledge of OpenGL and this error suggests that this may be

</I>&gt;<i> EXT_texture_compression_s3tc among others) however states that if the width
</I>&gt;<i> or height are not multiples of 4 then the result is an INVALID_OPERATION.
</I>&gt;<i> This can go unnoticed when not using a texture storage object.  But with
</I>&gt;<i> the texture storage object, the error was generated when loading the full
</I>&gt;<i> texture (i.e. level 0).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If my understanding is correct, others may have had similar issues with
</I>&gt;<i> compressed textures with mipmaps. They have worked around the issue by
</I>&gt;<i> disabling mipmaps for compressed textures in ReaderWriterDDS for example.
</I>&gt;<i> If the above holds true, then it may point to the underlying problem.
