<PRE>Hi,

Wrt Qt: you might be interested in the upcoming rendering interface 
abstraction where no direct OpenGL calls are made anymore. Not sure if 
it helps, let us know!

Cheers, good luck,
Raymond

</I>&gt;<i> Ufff, you are in for quite a battle, I am afraid. I have done this few
</I>&gt;<i> years ago when we were using Ogre and OSG for our virtual reality
</I>&gt;<i> simulators at work and we needed a proper UI framework to display user
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces inside the application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You have basically two options:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) Render the Qt widget/window into a texture/image, grab that and
</I>&gt;<i> display it as an OSG texture. Input from OSG can be fed into Qt's event
</I>&gt;<i> system by artificially creating and injecting events.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This works and it is how we have done it. Qt widgets can render
</I>&gt;<i> themselves into an image/texture directly, simply by calling their
</I>&gt;<i> render() method with proper arguments. We were able to display most Qt
</I>&gt;<i> widgets and render QML using OSG textures. Where things get very hairy
</I>&gt;<i> is the state management between OSG and Qt (Qt uses its own OpenGL
</I>&gt;<i> backend for rendering and assumes that it is in a certain state!) and
</I>&gt;<i> then input. When you aren't rendering Qt the usual way by showing
</I>&gt;<i> windows on screen but you only call render() and grab a texture, Qt will
</I>&gt;<i> not initialize some internal state relating to issues such as cursor,
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard focus, state of some widgets, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The result is that you will have problems with cursor disappearing,
</I>&gt;<i> widgets not accepting keyboard input, keyboard shortcuts not working and
</I>&gt;<i> myriads of other problems like this. It can be solved to some degree by
</I>&gt;<i> digging into the Qt's source code, seeing which flags it is relying on
</I>&gt;<i> where and then manually calling the necessary functions to ensure that
</I>&gt;<i> they are set correctly. We have managed to get it to such shape that the
</I>&gt;<i> UIs were usable but if you need a very complex UI you will likely run
</I>&gt;<i> into problems. Also OSG's event system doesn't handle anywhere close to
</I>&gt;<i> the gamut of input events that Qt does, so a lot of things will have to
</I>&gt;<i> be emulated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b) Implement a new Qt backend running on top of OSG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Qt implements several of these backends, including a basic framebuffer
</I>&gt;<i> and OpenGL already, that is how they port Qt to different platforms,
</I>&gt;<i> such as phones or embedded hardware. This would be probably cleaner
</I>&gt;<i> approach if you really need the entire Qt to work but also a lot more
</I>&gt;<i> work than the above, because the API is fairly extensive, not super well
</I>&gt;<i> documented (this are really the dirty guts of Qt you aren't supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> normally see)&#160; and may not have a completely straightforward mapping to OSG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck,
</I>&gt;<i>
